<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_7" title="7"> </a>PREFACE</h2>

<p><span class="small-caps">The</span> following pages embody the result of an observational
study of the social phenomena attendant upon one of
the greatest catastrophies in history&mdash;the Halifax Disaster.
The idea of the work was suggested while carrying out a
civic community study of the disaster city under the direction
of Professor F.&nbsp;H. Giddings of Columbia University.</p>

<p>The account deals first with the shock and disintegration
as the writer observed it. Individual and group reactions
are next examined in the light of sociological theory.
The <a href="#Chapter_3">chapters on Social Organization</a> are an effort to picture
that process as it actually occurred.</p>

<p>The writer has also tried faithfully to record any important
contribution which Social Economy was able to
make in the direction of systematic rehabilitation. Special
reference is made to private initiative and governmental
control in emergency relief. This monograph is in no
sense, however, a relief survey. Its chief value to the
literature of relief will lie in its bearing upon predictable
social movements in great emergencies.</p>

<p>Nor is the book a history of the disaster. It is rather,
as the title suggests, an intensive study of two social orders,
between which stands a great catastrophe, and its thesis is
the place of catastrophe in social change.</p>

<p>In the preparation of this work, which the author believes
to be the first attempt to present a purely scientific
and sociological treatment of any great disaster, he has received
invaluable assistance. A few grateful lines can
ill-express his obligation to his Professors of the Department
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_8" title="8"> </a>
of Sociology. To Professor F.&nbsp;H. Giddings the volume owes
its inspiration and much of its social philosophy. To Professor
A.&nbsp;A. Tenney it owes its present form and structure
and any literary excellence it may possess. Professor R.&nbsp;E.
Chaddock has read the manuscript throughout and has
contributed many helpful suggestions. Professor S.&nbsp;M. Lindsay
has read the <a href="#Chapter_6">chapter on Social Legislation</a>, and Professor
R.&nbsp;S. Woodworth of the Department of Psychology,
<a href="#Chapter_2">that on Disaster Psychology</a>. The author is under special
tribute to Professor H.&nbsp;R. Seager, and to Professor Tenney,
who most cheerfully sacrificed part of a summer vacation
to read and revise the manuscript and proof.</p>

<p>Without the walls of the University there are also those
who have given aid. The author gratefully acknowledges
the assistance of Dr. Edward T. Devine of New York,
of Mr. C.&nbsp;C. Carstens of Boston, of Mr. Thomas Mackay,
of Ottawa, and of Miss E.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A. Vaughan, of the St. John
Public Library. He has enjoyed the coöperation of many
friends and fellow-townsmen of Halifax. He desires to
thank particularly, Miss L.&nbsp;F. Barnaby, of the Halifax
Citizens' Library, Miss J.&nbsp;B. Wisdom, of the Halifax Welfare
Bureau, Rev. W.&nbsp;J. Patton of St. Paul's Church, Mr.
W.&nbsp;C. Milner, of the Public Archives of Canada, Mr. L.&nbsp;Fred.
Monaghan, Halifax City Clerk, Mr. G.&nbsp;K. Butler,
Supervisor of Halifax Schools, Mr. R.&nbsp;M. Hattie, Secretary
of the Halifax Town-Planning Commission, Dr. Franklin B.
Royer, Director of the Massachusetts-Halifax Health Commission,
Mr. E.&nbsp;A. Saunders, Secretary of the Halifax
Board of Trade, Mr. E.&nbsp;H. Blois, Superintendent of
Neglected and Delinquent Children, and last of all and most
of all his friend of many years, Mr. A.&nbsp;J. Johnstone, editor
of the <cite>Dartmouth Independent</cite>.</p>

for study.</p>

<p>There are many virgin fields in Sociology. This is one
of the attractions the subject has for the scientific mind.
But of all such fields none is more interesting than the
factor of catastrophe in social change.</p>

<p>And strangely enough, if there are but few references to
the problem in all our rapidly-growing literature, it is not
because catastrophies are few. Indeed it would seem that
with the advent of the industrial age, disasters grow more
frequent every year.<a name="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Many are small, no doubt, touching
but the life of a village or a borough&mdash;a broken dyke, a
bridge swept out by ice, a caved-in mine. Others again
write themselves on the pages of History&mdash;an Ohio flood,
an Omaha tornado, a Chicago fire, a San Francisco earthquake,
a Halifax explosion. Each in its own way inscribes its
records of social change&mdash;some to be effaced in a twelve-month&mdash;some
to outlast a generation. Records they are,
for the most part unread. How to read them is the problem.
And it may be that when readers have grown in
number and the script is better known, we shall be able to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_14" title="14"> </a>
seize the moment of catastrophe and multiply immeasurably
its power for social good.</p>

<p>To define the term catastrophe is scarcely necessary. The
dictionary calls catastrophe &ldquo;an event producing a subversion
of the order or system of things,&rdquo; and such as &ldquo;may
or may not be a cause of misery to man.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> It is desirable
however to limit the use of the term, in primary investigations
at least, to those disasters which affect communities
rather than states or nations, for restricted areas are more
amenable to study. National cataclysms, such as war,
famine, and financial panic are too general in character, and
function on too grand a scale for satisfactory treatment,
at least until the ground is cleared. It is necessary also to
limit this investigation to those social changes which follow
upon catastrophies, rather than precede them. For
there are social effects which result from living in anticipation
of disaster, such as are observable among communities
in volcanic areas. Interesting as a broad study might be,
it would be likely to lead the investigator too far afield into
the realm of speculation. Nevertheless a general point of
view is necessary to give meaning to even a limited treatment
of the theme. For this purpose there may be contrasted
the catastrophic view of history, as illustrated by
that of the Hebrew peoples, and the modern conception of
progress through evolution. The former looks upon history
as a series of vicissitudes mercifully ending one day
in final cataclysm. The spirit of apocalyptic expectancy prevails.
Social conditions rest hopelessly static. Faith is
pinned to a spiritual kingdom which can grow and can endure.
Against this has been set an optimistic evolution,
pictured like an escalade with resident forces lifting the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_15" title="15"> </a>
world to better days. Progress becomes a smooth continuous
growth. On the other hand the newer philosophy
sees in history not necessarily the operation of progressive
evolution but also of retrogressive evolution and cataclysm.<a name="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
There are great stretches of smooth and even current in
the stream, but always along the course are seen the rapid
and the water-fall, the eddy and reversing tide. The latter
is the general subject of this dissertation, and its thesis
is the place of the water-fall. Only a very small, and
specialized treatment is attempted; the great Niagaras must
be left to abler hands.</p>

<p>The conception of social change as used in this monograph
also needs definition. By social change is meant those rapid
mutations which accompany sudden interferences with the
equilibrium of society, break up the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">status-quo</i>, dissipate
mental inertia and overturn other tendencies resistant to
structural modification. The various forces which initiate
such disturbances are factors in social change. These
factors may be intra-social,&mdash;within the group&mdash;such factors
as operate in the regular social process, imitation and adaptation,
for example; or they may be extra-social, &ldquo;stimuli&rdquo;
factors&mdash;from without the group&mdash;such as, accidental, extraneous
or dramatic events. Of the latter conquest may
be one, or the sudden intrusion of a foreign element, or
rapid changes of environment.<a name="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_16" title="16"> </a>These sudden changes are fully worthy of careful study
by scientific method. However important the accumulation
of impulses toward social transformation may be, there
is often a single &ldquo;precipitating factor&rdquo; which acts as the
&ldquo;igniting spark&rdquo; or &ldquo;the knocking away of the stay-block,&rdquo;
or &ldquo;the turning of a lever.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It is among such
extra-social or &ldquo;stimuli&rdquo; factors that catastrophe falls
as a precipitating agent in social change.</p>

<p>The significance of crisis in social change likewise requires
attention, and it will be clarifying to our thought at
this point to distinguish carefully between crisis and
catastrophe, and to inquire what the nature of the former
really is. The word &ldquo;crisis&rdquo; is of Greek origin, meaning
a point of culmination and separation, an instant when
change one way or another is impending. Crises are those
critical moments which are, as we say, big with destiny.
Battles have crisis-hours when the tide of victory turns.
Diseases have them&mdash;the seventh day in pneumonia, or the
fourteenth day in typhoid fever. Social institutions afford
numerous illustrations, such as the eighth year of marriage.<a name="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
There are critical years of stress and strain&mdash;the ages
of fourteen and forty in life-histories, the latter being according
to Sir Robertson Nicoll the most dangerous hour
of existence. Other crises are &ldquo;hours of insight&rdquo; in the
world of thought, and hours of opportunity in the world of
action,&mdash;that &ldquo;tide in the affairs of men, which taken at the
flood leads on to fortune,&rdquo; hours of doubt in religion &ldquo;when
all the gods are dead.&rdquo; &ldquo;Crisis,&rdquo; Professor Shailer <ins title="Matthews">Mathews</ins>
observes, &ldquo;is something more than a relative term.
It describes a situation which is no ordinary member of a
line of antecedents and consequents, but one that assures
radical change in the immediate future.&rdquo; He distinguishes
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_17" title="17"> </a>
between a crisis and a revolution. &ldquo;The difference between
a revolution and a crisis is the difference between
the fire and the moment when someone with a lighted match
in hand pauses to decide whether a fire shall be lighted.&rdquo;
The term covers the situation preceding change, whether
this situation be the culmination of a process or the result
of some particular stimulus. &ldquo;It is not necessarily precipitated
by great issues. Quite as often it is occasioned
by events .... which are so related to a new situation
as to set in motion an entire group of forces as a match
kindles a huge bonfire when once the fuel is laid.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The
failure to distinguish between that which occasions the
crisis and the crisis itself has been the source of some confusion
in thinking. &ldquo;Defeat in battle, floods, drought,
pestilence and famine,&rdquo; are not strictly crises, but they
super-induce the crisis-situation, as does anything which
brings about &ldquo;a disturbance of habit,&rdquo; though it be simply
&ldquo;an incident, a stimulation or a suggestion.&rdquo; In short,
crises are the result either of a slowly maturing process or of
sudden strain or shock; and the nature of the reaction in
the crisis-hour is nothing more than the effort towards the
reëstablishment of habits, new or old, when the former
functioning has been disturbed. The situation, as has been
pointed out, is closely correlated with attention.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the habits are running smoothly the attention is relaxed;
it is not at work. But when something happens to disturb
the run of habit, the attention is called into play, and devises
a new mode of behavior which will meet the crisis. That
is, the attention establishes new and adequate habits, or it is
its function so to do.<a name="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent"><a class="pagenum" name="Page_18" title="18"> </a>What appears to take place is analogous to what is known as
the reconditioning of instincts in psychology. Professor Giddings
has been the first to make the sociological application:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Folk-ways of every kind, including mores and themistes are
the most stable syntheses of pluralistic behavior; yet they are
not unchanging. Under new and widening experience they
suffer attrition and are modified. Instincts and with them
emotion and imagination which largely fills the vast realm
between instinct and reason are reconditioned. The word
means simply that reflexes and higher processes subjected to
new experiences are in a degree or entirely detached from old
stimuli and associated with new ones. From time to time also
traditions are invaded and habits are broken down by crisis.
Pluralistic behavior then is scrutinized, criticized, discussed.
It is rationally deliberated.<a name="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Crises often, perhaps most often, precede catastrophies,
as when revolutions break. The alternate truth that the
catastrophies themselves are re-agents to generate the
crisis-situation has not been so commonly noted. Nevertheless
the disintegration of the normal by shock and
calamity is an increasingly familiar spectacle.</p>

<p>Heretofore it has been in the life-histories and careers of
individual men rather than in the case of communities that
the observations have been recorded. Our biographies teem
with instances of personal crises precipitated by a great shock
or disappointment&mdash;Hawthorne's dismissal from the custom
house, Goldsmith's rejection from Civil Service, the refusal
of Dickens's application for the stage, the turning back of
Livingstone from China, the bankruptcy of Scott.</p>

<p>Now examination reveals that the one thing characteristic
of the crisis-period in the individual is a state of fluidity<a name="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_19" title="19"> </a>
into which the individual is thrown. Life becomes like
molten metal. It enters a state of flux<a name="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> from which it
must reset upon a principle, a creed, or purpose. It is
shaken perhaps violently out of rut and routine. Old customs
crumble, and instability rules. There is generated a
state of potentiality for reverse directions. The subject
may &ldquo;fall down&rdquo; or he may &ldquo;fall up.&rdquo; The presence of
dynamic forces in such a state means change. But the
precise rôle of the individual mind in a period of crisis is
a problem not for sociology but for psychology.</p>

<p>The principle that fluidity is fundamental to social
change is also true, however, of the community. Fluidity
is not the usual state of society.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most of the &ldquo;functions&rdquo; of society have no tendency to disturb
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">status quo</i>. The round of love, marriage and reproduction,
so long as births and death balance, production so far
as it is balanced by consumption, exchange so long as the
argosies of commerce carry goods and not ideas, education so
far as it passes on the traditional culture, these together with
recreation, social intercourse, worship, social control, government
and the administration of justice are essentially statical.
They might conceivably go on forever without producing
change.<a name="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Indeed the usual condition of the body politic is immobility,
conservatism and &ldquo;determined resistance to
change.&rdquo; The chief reason for this immobility is habit:<a name="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_20" title="20"> </a>When our habits are settled and running smoothly they most
resemble the instincts of animals. And the great part of our
life is lived in the region of habit. The habits like the instincts
are safe and serviceable. They have been tried and are
associated with a feeling of security. There consequently
grows up in the folk mind a determined resistance to change
... a state of rapid and constant change implies loss of
settled habits and disorganization. As a result, all societies
view change with suspicion, and the attempt to revise certain
habits is even viewed as immorality. Now it is possible under
such conditions for a society to become stationary or to attempt
to remain so. The effort of attention is to preserve the present
status, rather than to re-accommodate. This condition is particularly
marked among savages. In the absence of science
and a proper estimate of the value of change they rely on
ritual and magic and a minute unquestioning adhesion to the
past. Change is consequently introduced with a maximum of
resistance ... Indeed the only world in which change is at a
premium and is systematically sought is the modern scientific
world.<a name="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">But when there comes the shattering of the matrix of
custom by catastrophe, then mores are broken up and scattered
right and left. Fluidity is accomplished at a stroke.
There comes a sudden chance for permanent social change.</p>

<p>Social changes follow both minor and major disasters.
The destruction of a mill may change the economic outlook
of a village. The loss of a bridge may result in an entirely
different school system for an isolated community; a cloud-burst
may move a town. Great visitations, like the Chicago
fire or the San Francisco earthquake, reveal these social
processes in larger and more legible scale. Take as a
single instance the latter city. Its quick recovery has been
called one of the wonders of the age. In the very midst of
surrounding desolation and business extinction, the Californian
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_21" title="21"> </a>
city projected a Panama-Pacific exposition, and its
citizens proceeded to arrange for one of the greatest of all
world fairs. On the other hand, the social changes which
succeed relatively small disturbances are often such as to
elude an estimate. The reason has been well suggested
that &ldquo;big crises bring changes about most easily because
they affect all individuals alike at the same time.&rdquo; In other
words a more general fluidity is accomplished. We see,
therefore, a second principle begin to emerge. Not only
is fluidity fundamental to social change, but the degree of
fluidity seems to vary directly as the shock and extent of the
catastrophe.</p>

<p>There yet remains to notice the bearing of catastrophe
upon social progress. The following words are quotable
in this connection:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is quite certain that the degree of progress of a people
has a certain relation to the number of disturbances encountered,
and the most progressive have had a more vicissitudinous
life. Our proverb &ldquo;Necessity is the mother of invention&rdquo; is
the formulation in folk-thought of this principle of social
change.<a name="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">We cannot, however, remain long content with this suggestion
as to the principle concerned&mdash;namely, that progress
is a natural and an assured result of change. The point is
that catastrophe always means social change. There is not
always progress. It is well to guard against confusion here.
Change means any qualitative variation, whereas progress
means &ldquo;amelioration, perfectionment.&rdquo; The latter will
be seen to depend on other things&mdash;the nature of the shock,
the models presented, the community culture and morale,
the stimulus of leaders and lookers-on. The single case of
Galveston, Texas,<a name="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> is sufficient to disprove the too optimistic
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_22" title="22"> </a>
hypothesis that the effects of catastrophies are uniform.
Here a city lost heart by reason of the overwhelming flood,
and in spite of superior commercial advantages was outgrown
by a rival fifty miles away. At the same time the
case of Dayton, Ohio, should be borne in mind. Here also
was a flood-stricken city and she became &ldquo;the Gem City of
the West.&rdquo; The principle<a name="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> thus appears to be that progress
in catastrophe is a resultant of specific conditioning factors,
some of which are subject to social control.</p>

<p>It is indeed this very thing which makes possible the hope
of eventual social control over disaster-stricken cities, and
the transmutation of seeming evil into tremendous good.
And this is in addition to the many practical social lessons
which we have already been intelligent enough to preserve,
such as those of better city-planning, and a more efficient
charity organization.</p>

<p>How much of man's advancement has been directly or
indirectly due to disaster?<a name="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> The question asks itself and
it is a question as yet without an answer. When the answer
is at last written, will there not be many surprises? Pitt-Rivers
tells us that &ldquo;the idea of a large boat might have
been suggested in the time of floods when houses floated
down the rivers before the eyes of men.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> A terrible
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_23" title="23"> </a>
storm at sea gave America its first rice.<a name="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> City-planning may
be said to have taken its rise in America as a result of the
Chicago fire, and the rôle of catastrophe in the progress of
social legislation is a study in itself. The impetus thus
received is immeasurable. Historically, labor-legislation
took its rise with the coming of an infectious fever in the
cotton-mills of Manchester in 1784. After the Cherry mine
disaster legislation ensued at once. Again it was the
Triangle fire which led to the appropriation of funds for
a factory investigation commission in the State of New
York. The sinking of the Titanic has greatly reduced the
hazards of the sea.</p>

<p>It may easily prove true that the prophets of golden days
to come who invariably arise on the day of disaster, are not
entirely without ground for the faith which is in them; and
that catastrophies are frequently only re-agents of further
progress. But this is merely introductory. Thought becomes
scientific only when its conclusions are checked up
and under-written by observation or experiment. Prior to
such procedure it must still remain opinion or belief.</p>

<p>The whole subject is, it must be repeated, a virgin field
in sociology. Knowledge will grow scientific only after
the most faithful examination of many catastrophies. But
it must be realized that the data of the greatest value is left
ofttimes unrecorded, and fades rapidly from the social
memory. Investigation is needed immediately after the
event. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that
sociological studies of Chicago, Galveston, Baltimore, San
Francisco, and other disaster cities should be initiated at once.<a name="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a></p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_24" title="24"> </a>Of such a series&mdash;if the work can be done&mdash;this little
volume on Halifax is offered as a beginning. It is hoped that
the many inadequacies of treatment will receive the generous
allowances permitted a pioneer.</p>

<p><span class="small-caps">Halifax</span> is the ocean terminal of the Dominion of
Canada on her Atlantic seaboard. It is situated at the head
of Chebucto <ins title="Bay">Bay,</ins> a deep inlet on the southeastern shoreline
of Nova Scotia. It is endowed by nature with a magnificent
harbor, which as a matter of fact is one of the three
finest in the world. In it a thousand vessels might safely
ride at anchor. The possession of this harbor, together
with ample defences, and a fortunate situation with regard
to northern Europe established the Garrison City, early in
the year 1914 as the natural war-base of the Dominion.
Its tonnage leaped by millions, and it soon became the third
shipping port in the entire British Empire. Hither the
transports came, and the giant freighters to join their convoy.
Cruisers and men-of-war put in to use its great dry-dock,
or take on coal. Here too, cleared the supply and munition
boats&mdash;some laden with empty shells, others with high explosives
destined for the distant fields of battle. How much
of the deadly cargo lay in the road-stead or came and went
during those fateful years is not publicly known.<a name="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Certainly
there was too much to breed a sense of safety, but no
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_26" title="26"> </a>
one gave the matter second thought. All were intent upon
the mighty task of the hour. Sufficient unto each day was
each day's evil. Each night the great war-gates were swung
across the channels. Powerful searchlights swept unceasingly
the sea and sky. The forts were fully manned. The
gunners ready. The people knew these things, and no one
dreamed of danger save to loved ones far away. Secure in
her own defences the city lay unafraid, and almost apathetic.</p>

<p>About midway in the last two years of war&mdash;to be exact
December, 1917,&mdash;a French munitioner<a name="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> heavily laden
with trinitrotoluol, the most powerful of known explosives,
reached Halifax from New York. On the early morning
of the sixth of that month, she was proceeding under her
own steam up the harbor-length toward anchorage in the
basin&mdash;an oval expansion half-hidden by a blunt hill called
Turple Head. Suddenly an empty Belgian relief ship<a name="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
swept through the Narrows directly in her pathway. There
was a confusion of signals; a few agonized manoeuvers.
The vessels collided; and the shock of their colliding shook
the world!</p>

<p>War came to America that morning. Two thousand
slain, six thousand injured, ten thousand homeless, thirty-five
millions of dollars in property destroyed, three hundred
acres left a smoking waste, churches, schools, factories
blown down or burned&mdash;such was the appalling havoc of the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_27" title="27"> </a>
greatest single explosion in the history of the world.<a name="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> It
was an episode which baffles description. It is difficult to
gain from words even an approximate idea of the catastrophe
and what followed in its trail.</p>

<p>It was all of a sudden&mdash;a single devastating blast; then
the sound as of the crashing of a thousand chandeliers.
Men and women cowered under the shower of debris and
glass. There was one awful moment when hearts sank,
and breaths were held. Then women cried aloud, and men
looked dumbly into each other's eyes, and awaited the crack
of doom. To some death was quick and merciful in its
coming. Others were blinded, and staggered to <ins title="an">and</ins> fro
before they dropped. Still others with shattered limbs dragged
themselves forth into the light&mdash;naked, blackened, unrecognizable
human shapes. They lay prone upon the
streetside, under the shadow of the great death-cloud which
still dropped soot and oil and water. It was truly a sight
to make the angels weep.</p>

<p>Men who had been at the front said they had seen
nothing so bad in Flanders. Over there men were torn with
shrapnel, but the victims were in all cases men. Here
father and mother, daughter and little child, all fell in
&ldquo;one red burial blent.&rdquo; A returned soldier said of it: &ldquo;I
have been in the trenches in France. I have gone over the
top. Friends and comrades have been shot in my presence.
I have seen scores of dead men lying upon the battlefield,
but the sight .... was a thousand times worse and far
more pathetic.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> A well-known relief worker who had
been at San Francisco, Chelsea and Salem immediately after
those disasters said &ldquo;I am impressed by the fact that this is
much the saddest disaster I have seen.&rdquo; It has been compared
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_28" title="28"> </a>
to the scenes pictured by Lord Lytton in his tale of
the last days of Pompeii:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>True there was not that hellish river of molten lava flowing
down upon the fleeing people; and consuming them as feathers
in fierce flames. But every other sickening detail was present&mdash;that
of crashing shock and shaking earth, of crumbling
homes, and cruel flame and fire. And there were showers, not
it is true of ashes from the vortex of the volcano, but of soot
and oil and water, of death-dealing fragments of shrapnel and
deck and boiler, of glass and wood and of the shattered ship.<a name="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">Like the New Albany tornado, it caused loss &ldquo;in all five
of the ways it is possible for a disaster to do so, in death,
permanent injury, temporary injury, personal property loss,
and real property loss.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Here were to be found in one
dread assembling the combined horrors of war, earthquake,
fire, flood, famine and storm&mdash;a combination seen for the
first time in the records of human disaster.</p>

<p>It was an earthquake<a name="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> so violent that when the explosion
occurred the old, rock-founded city shook as with palsy.
The citadel trembled, the whole horizon seemed to move
with the passing of the earth waves. These were caught
and registered, their tracings<a name="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> carefully preserved, but the
mute record tells not of the falling roofs and flying plaster
and collapsing walls which to many an unfortunate victim
brought death and burial at one and the same time.</p>

<p>It was a flood, for the sea rushed forward in a gigantic
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_29" title="29"> </a>
tidal wave, fully a fathom in depth. It swept past pier and
embankment into the lower streets, and receding, left boats
and wreckage high and dry, but carried to a watery doom
score upon score of human lives. Nearly two hundred men
were drowned.</p>

<p>It was a fire or rather a riot of fires, for the air was for
a second filled with tongues of igneous vapour hiding themselves
secretly within the lightning discharge of gas, only
to burst out in gusts of sudden flame. Numberless buildings
were presently ablaze. Soon there was naught to the
northward but a roaring furnace. Above, the sky was
crimson; below, a living crematorium&mdash;church and school,
factory and home burned together in one fierce conflagration;
and the brave firemen knew that there were men and
women pinned beneath the wreckage, wounded past self-help.
Frantic mothers heard the cries of little children, but
in vain. Fathers desperately tore through burning brands,
but often failed to save alive the captives of the flame. And
so the last dread process went on,&mdash;earth to earth, ashes to
ashes, dust to dust. And when the fires at last abated, the
north end of the City of Halifax looked like some blackened
hillside which a farmer had burned for fallow in the
spring.</p>

<p>But perhaps the most terrible of all the terrible accompaniments
was the tornado-like gas-blast from the bursting
ship. It wrought instant havoc everywhere. Trees were
torn from the ground. Poles were snapped like toothpicks.
Trains were stopped dead. Cars were left in twisted masses.
Pedestrians were thrown violently into the air, houses
collapsed on all sides. Steamers were slammed against the
docks. Then followed a veritable air-raid, when the sky
rained iron fragments upon the helpless city. Like a meteoric
shower of death, they fell piercing a thousand roofs, and
with many a mighty splash bore down into the sea.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_30" title="30"> </a>Nor yet did this complete the tale of woes of this <cite lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dies
Irae</cite>. Scarce was the catastrophe an hour old when the
news was flashed around that a second explosion was approaching.
It was the powder magazine in the Navy-yard,
and the flames were perilously near. Through the
crowded streets raced the heralds like prophets of wrath to
come. &ldquo;Flee!.... Flee!.... Get into the open
ground&rdquo; was the cry. Shops were abandoned unguarded,
goods laid open on every side. No key was turned, no till
was closed, but all instanter joined the precipitant throng,
driven like animals before a prairie fire&mdash;yet this was not all;
for &ldquo;the plight of the aged, the sick, the infants, the bed-ridden,
the cripples, the nursing mothers, the pregnant can
not be described.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was like the flight from Vesuvius of which Pliny the
Younger tells:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You could hear the shrieks of women, the crying of children
and the shouts of men. Some were seeking their children;
others their parents, others their wives and husbands ... one
lamenting his own fate, another that of his family. Some
praying to die from the very fear of dying, many lifting their
hands to the gods, but the greater part imagining that there
were no gods left anywhere, and that the last and eternal night
was come upon the world.<a name="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">It has been said that &ldquo;Moscow was no more deserted before
Napoleon than were the shattered streets of Halifax when
this flight had been carried out.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> And when the hegira
was over, and when there had ensued a partial recovery
from the blow and gloom, a still lower depth of agony had
yet to be undergone&mdash;a succession of winter storms. Blizzards,
rain, floods and zero weather were even then upon
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_31" title="31"> </a>
the way. They came in close procession and as if to crown
and complete the terrors of the great catastrophe thunder
rumbled, lightning broke sharply and lit up weirdly the
snow-clad streets. Such was the catastrophe of Halifax&mdash;&ldquo;a
calamity the appalling nature of which stirred the imagination
of the world.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The description here concluded, brief and inadequate
as it is, will sufficiently indicate the terrific nature of the
catastrophic shock, and explain how utter and complete was
the social disintegration which followed.</p>

<p>There was the disintegration of the home and the family,&mdash;the
reproductive system of society&mdash;its members sundered
and helpless to avert it. There was the disintegration
of the regulative system&mdash;government was in perplexity,
and streets were without patrol. There was the disintegration
of the sustaining system&mdash;a dislocation of transportation,
a disorganization of business while the wheels of industry
ceased in their turning. There was a derangement
of the distributive system<a name="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>&mdash;of all the usual services, of illumination,
water-connections, telephones, deliveries. It was
impossible to communicate with the outside world. There
were no cars, no mails, no wires. There was a time when
the city ceased to be a city, its citizens a mass of unorganized
units&mdash;struggling for safety, shelter, covering and bread.
As Lytton wrote of Pompeii; &ldquo;The whole elements of
civilization were broken up .... nothing in all the varied
and complicated machinery of social life was left save the
primal law of self preservation.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>A writer has given a vivid word picture of the social contrasts
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_32" title="32"> </a>
of the disaster night and the beautiful evening before.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What a change from the night before! No theatres open, no
happy throngs along the street, no cheery gatherings around the
fire-side. The houses were all cold, and dark and silent. Instead
of laughter, weeping; instead of dancing, agonizing
pain; instead of Elysian dreams, ominous nightmares. Fears
and sorrow were in the way and all the daughters of music
were brought low ... Halifax had become in a trice a city
of dead bodies, ruined homes and blasted hopes.<a name="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">To have looked in upon one of the great makeshift dormitories
that first night, to have seen men, women and children,
of all stations, huddled together on the stages of theatres,
the chancels of churches, in stables, box-cars and basements
was to have beheld a rift in the social structure such as no
community had ever known. Old traditional social lines
were hopelessly mixed and confused. The catastrophe
smashed through strong walls like cobwebs, but it also
smashed through fixed traditions, social divisions and old
standards, making a rent which would not easily repair.
Rich and poor, debutante and chambermaid, official and bellboy
met for the first time as victims of a common calamity.</p>

<p>Even on the eighth, two days after the disaster, when
Mr. Ratshesky of the Massachusetts' Relief arrived he
could report: &ldquo;An awful sight presented itself, buildings
shattered on all sides&mdash;chaos apparent.&rdquo; In a room in
the City Hall twelve by twenty, he found assembled &ldquo;men
and women trying to organize different departments of relief,
while other rooms were filled to utmost capacity with
people pleading for doctors, nurses, food, and clothing for
themselves and members of their families. Everything was
in turmoil.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> This account faithfully expresses the disintegration
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_33" title="33"> </a>
which came with the great shock of what had
come to pass. It is this disintegration and the resultant
phenomena which are of utmost importance for the student
of social science to observe. To be quite emotionally free in
the observation of such phenomena, however, is almost impossible.
It has been said of sociological investigations that</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="no-indent">observation is made under bias because the facts under review
are those of human life and touch human interest. A man can
count the legs of a fly without having his heart wrung because
he thinks there are too many or too few. But when he observes
the life of the society in which he moves, lives and has his being,
or some other society nearby, it is the rule that he approves or
disapproves, is edified or horrified, by what he observes. When
he does that he passes a moral judgment.<a name="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">Sociology has suffered because of this inevitable bias. In
our present study it is natural that our sympathy reactions
should be especially strong. &ldquo;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quamquam animus meminisse
horret, incipiam</i>&rdquo; must be our motto. As students
we must now endeavor to dissociate ourselves from them,
and look upon the stricken Canadian city with all a chemist's
patient detachment. In a field of science where the prospect
of large-scale experimental progress is remote, we must
learn well when the abnormal reveals itself in great tragedies
and when social processes are seen magnified by a thousand
diameters. Only thus can we hope for advances that will
endure.</p>

<p>In this spirit then let us watch the slow process of the
reorganization of Halifax, and see in it a picture of society
itself as it reacts under the stimulus of catastrophe, and
adjusts itself to the circumstantial pressure of new conditions.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_34" title="34"> </a>Before doing so, however, we shall pause, in the <a href="#Chapter_2">next
chapter</a>, to glance at a number of social phenomena which
should be recorded and examined in the light of social
psychology. But we must not lose the relationship of each
chapter to our major thesis. It is sufficient for our purpose
if thus far it has been shown that at Halifax the shock resulted
in disintegration of social institutions, dislocation of
the usual methods of social control and dissolution of the
customary; that through the catastrophe the community
was thrown into the state of flux which, as was suggested
in the <a href="#Page_13">introduction</a>, is the logical and natural prerequisite
for social change; and finally that the shock was of a
character such as &ldquo;to affect all individuals alike at the same
time,&rdquo; and to induce that degree of fluidity most favorable
to social change.</p>

phenomena&mdash;Human nature in the absence of repression

<p><span class="small-caps">Social</span> Psychology is a subject of primary importance
to the student of society. Like Sociology itself its field
is far from being exhausted. One looks in vain for a treatment
of disaster psychology. In such a study the diverse
phenomena involved would be of interest to the psychologist.
Their effects in retarding or promoting social organization
would concern the sociologist. With such possible effects
in mind we are now to proceed to an examination of the
major subjective reactions as they were to be seen in the
Halifax catastrophe.</p>

<p>It is improbable that any single community has ever
presented so composite a picture of human traits in such
bold relief as appeared in the City of Halifax upon the day
of the explosion. Human phenomena which many knew
of only as hidden away in books, stood out so clearly that
he who ran might read. Besides the physiological reactions
there was abundant illustration of hallucination, delusion,
primitive instincts, and crowd psychology as well of
other phenomena all of which have important sociological
significance tending either to prolong disintegration, or to
hasten social recovery.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_36" title="36"> </a>The first of these phenomena was the &ldquo;stun&rdquo; of the
catastrophe itself. The shock reaction at Halifax has been
variously described. It has been graphically likened &ldquo;to
being suddenly stricken with blindness and paralysis.&rdquo; It
was a sensation of utter helplessness and disability. &ldquo;We
died a thousand horrible deaths&rdquo; ran one description, &ldquo;the
nervous shock and terror were as hard to bear as were the
wounds.&rdquo; &ldquo;The people are dazed,&rdquo; wrote another observer,
&ldquo;they have almost ceased to exercise the sensation
of pain.&rdquo; This physiological reaction animals and men
shared alike. The appearance of the terror-stricken horses
was as of beasts which had suddenly gone mad.</p>

<p>A physiological accompaniment of shock and distraction
is the abnormal action of the glands. The disturbance of
the sympathetic nervous system produced by the emotional
stress and strain of a great excitement or a great disappointment
is reflected in the stimulation or inhibition of
glandular action. Much physical as well as nervous illness
was precipitated by the grief, excitement and exposure of
the disaster.<a name="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Among cases observed were those of diabetes,
tuberculosis and hyper-thyroidism, as well as the nervous
instability to which reference is subsequently made. Such
an epidemic of hyper-thyroidism&mdash;exaggerated action of
the thyroid gland&mdash;is said to have followed the Kishineff
massacres, the San Francisco earthquake and the air-raids
on London.<a name="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> As to diabetes, it has been shown that</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="no-indent">emotions cause increased output of glycogen. Glycogen is a
step toward diabetes and therefore this disease is prone to appear
in persons under emotional strain ... so common is this
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_37" title="37"> </a>particular result in persons under prolonged emotion that someone
has said that &ldquo;when stocks go down in New York, diabetes
goes up.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Turning now to other psychological aspects, we have
to note the presence of hallucination in disaster.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hallucination may be roughly defined as false sense impression.
For example, the patient sees an object which has
no real existence, or hears an imaginary voice. Hallucinations
are termed visual, auditory, tactile, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">etc.</i> according to the sense to
which the false impression appears to belong.<a name="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">Hallucination is induced by the unusual suggesting the expected.
It is sense-perception colored by association. It
is the power of a dominant idea that, unbidden, enters the
field of consciousness and takes possession of even the
senses themselves. In Halifax one idea seemed to dominate
most minds and clothe itself in the semblance of reality&mdash;the
expected Germans. For a long time there had been
under public discussion the question as to whether or not
the city would be shelled by Zeppelin raiders, or possibly by
a fleet at sea. All street-lights had been darkened by
military orders. The failure to draw window shades had
been subject to heavy penalty. It is no wonder eyes looked
upward when there came the crash, and when seeing the
strange unusual cloud beheld the Zeppelin of fancy. A
man residing on the outskirts of the town of Dartmouth
&ldquo;heard&rdquo; a German shell pass shrieking above him. Dartmouth
Heights looks out over Halifax harbor, and here
perhaps the vista is most expansive, and the eye sees furthest.
The instant after the explosion a citizen standing here
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_38" title="38"> </a>
&ldquo;saw&rdquo; clearly a German fleet manoeuvering in the distance.<a name="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
That shells had actually come few on the instant
doubted. The head of one firm advised his employees not
to run elsewhere, as &ldquo;two shots never fall in the same place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This&mdash;a German assault&mdash;was the great mental explanation
that came into the majority of minds. There was one
other&mdash;that of the end of the world. Many fell to their
knees in prayer. One woman was found in the open yard
by her broken home repeating the general confession of the
church. Few would have been surprised if out of the
smoky cloud-ridden skies there should have appeared the
archangels announcing the consummation of mundane affairs.
Indeed there were instances, not a few, of those
who &ldquo;saw&rdquo; in the death-cloud &ldquo;the clear outlines of a
face.&rdquo; Thus both auditory and visual hallucination were
manifested to a degree.</p>

<p>Hallucination has been described as &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; something
which has no basis in reality. Thus it differs from delusion,
which is rather a misinterpretation of what is seen. &ldquo;Delusions
are closely allied to hallucinations and generally accompany
the latter. The distinction lies in the fact that
delusions are not false sensations but false beliefs.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
Anxiety, distraction by grief and loss, as well as nervous
shock play freely with the mind and fancy and often swerve
the judgment of perception. This was especially noticeable
at Halifax in the hospital identification, particularly of
children. A distracted father looked into a little girl's
face four different times but did not recognize her as his
own which, in fact, she was. The precisely opposite occurrence
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_39" title="39"> </a>
was also noted. A fond parent time and time
again &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; his lost child, &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; to complete
satisfaction special marks and features on its little body.
But often there were present those who knew better, and
the better judgment prevailed. Again this phenomenon
was repeated in numberless instances at the morgue.
Wearied and white after frantic and fruitless search <ins title="whereever">wherever</ins>
refugees were gathered together, the overwrought
searchers would walk through the long lines of dead, and
suddenly &ldquo;recognize&rdquo; a missing relative or friend.<a name="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Regretfully
the attendant fulfilled the same thankless task
from day to day. There had been no recognition at all.
The observer had seen &ldquo;not the object itself but the image
evoked in the mind.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The primitive instincts of man were for a long time
vaguely and loosely defined, until James and later McDougall
essayed to give them name and number. But only
with Thorndike's critical examination has it become clear
how difficult a thing it is to carry the analysis of any situation
back to the elemental or &ldquo;primal movers of all human
activity.&rdquo; Thorndike is satisfied to describe them as nothing
save a set of original tendencies to respond to stimuli
in more or less definite directions. When he speaks of
instincts it is to mean only a &ldquo;series of situations and responses&rdquo;
or &ldquo;a set of tendencies for various situations to
arouse the feelings of fear, anger, pity, <i>etc.</i> with which
certain bodily movements usually go.&rdquo; Among them, there
are those resulting in &ldquo;food-getting and habitation,&rdquo; in
&ldquo;fear, fighting and anger&rdquo; and in &ldquo;human intercourse.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
But McDougall's classification preserves the old phrases,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_40" title="40"> </a>
and men are likely to go on speaking of the &ldquo;instinct of
flight,&rdquo; the &ldquo;instinct of pugnacity,&rdquo; &ldquo;parental instinct,&rdquo;
&ldquo;gregarious instinct&rdquo; and the others.<a name="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> For the sociologist
it is enough that all agree that men are held under some
powerful grip of nature and driven at times almost inevitably
to the doing of acts quite irrespective of their social
effects.</p>

<p>In catastrophe these primitive instincts are seen most
plainly and less subject to the re-conditioning influences
of ordinary life. This was especially noticeable at Halifax.
The instinct of flight for self-preservation was
reflected in the reaction of thousands. &ldquo;Almost without
thought, probably from the natural instinct of self-preservation
I backed from the window to a small store-room and
stood there dazed.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> The experience so described may be
said to have been general. This instinct was to be seen
again in the action of the crew of the explosives-laden ship.
Scarcely had the collision occurred when the whole complement
lowered away the boats, rowed like madmen to the
nearest shore&mdash;which happened to be that opposite to Halifax&mdash;and
&ldquo;scooted for the woods.&rdquo; As the ship, although
set on fire immediately after the impact, did not actually
blow up until some twenty minutes later, much might have
been done by men less under the domination of instinct, in
the way of warning and perhaps of minimizing the inevitable
catastrophe.<a name="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The instinct of pugnacity was to be seen in many a fine
example of difficulty overcome in the work of rescue; as
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_41" title="41"> </a>
also in other instances, some suggestive of that early combat
when animals and men struggled for mere physical
existence.</p>

<p>The parental instinct was everywhere in evidence, and
was reflected not only in the sacrifices made and the privations
endured by parents for their young, but in every act
of relief, which arose in involuntary response to the cry
of the distressed. It perhaps partially explains the phenomenon
often noticed in disasters that &ldquo;immediately and
spontaneously neighbors and fellow-townsmen spring to
the work of rescue and first aid.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>The gregarious instinct&mdash;the instinct to herd&mdash;showed
itself in the spontaneous groupings which came about and
which seemed somehow to be associated with feelings of
security from further harm. The refugees found comfort
in the group. They rarely remained alone.</p>

<p>These and other instinctive responses in a greater or less
degree of complication were to be remarked of the actions
not only of individuals but of groups as well. In the latter
the typical phenomena of crowd psychology were manifested
upon every hand. The crowd was seen to be what
it is&mdash;&ldquo;the like response of many to a socially inciting event
or suggestion such as sudden danger.&rdquo; Out of a mere
agglomeration of individuals and under the stress of emotional
excitement there arose that mental unity, which Le
Bon emphasizes.<a name="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> There was noticeable the feeling of
safety associated with togetherness which Trotter suggests.<a name="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>
There was the suggestibility, with its preceding conditions
which Sidis<a name="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> has clarified, namely, expectancy, inhibition,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_42" title="42"> </a>
and limitation of the field of consciousness. There were
the triple characteristics which Giddings notes: &ldquo;Crowds
are subject to swift contagion of feeling, they are sensitive
to suggestion .... and always manifest a tendency to
carry suggested ideas immediately into action.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Of illustrations of impulsive social action there are none
more apt than those furnished by the reactions following
the Halifax tragedy. Only Pliny's narrative of the flight
from the eruption of Vesuvius, or the story of the &ldquo;Day of
Fear&rdquo; in France,<a name="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> or that depicting the days of the comet<a name="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
are comparable thereto.</p>

<p>At first all was confusion. Some ran to the cellars.
Some ran to the streets. Some ran to their shops. Those in
the shops ran home. This was in the area of wounds and
bruises. Farther north was the area of death. Thither
the rescuers turned. Automobiles sped over broken glass
and splintered boards toward the unknown. Then came
the orders of the soldiers, whose barracks were situated
in the very heart of the danger district, for the people to
fly southward, Common-ward, to the open spaces&mdash;anywhere.
Another explosion was imminent. Then came
further outbreaks of the flight impulse. Runs a graphic
account:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The crowd needed no second warning. They turned and
fled. Hammers, shovels and bandages were thrown aside.
Stores were left wide open with piles of currency on their
counters. Homes were vacated in a twinkling. Little tots
couldn't understand why they were being dragged along so
fast. Some folks never looked back. Others did, either to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_43" title="43"> </a>catch a last glimpse of the home they never expected to see
again or to tell if they could from the sky how far behind them
the Dreaded Thing was.... They fled as they were.... Some
carried children or bundles of such things as they had scrambled
together.... Many were but scantily clad. Women fled
in their night dresses. A few were stark naked, their bodies
blackened with soot and grime. These had come from the
destroyed section of the North End. What a storm-tossed
motley throng, and as varied in its aspect and as poignant in
its sufferings as any band of Belgian or Serbian refugees fleeing
before the Hun.... A few rode in autos, but the great
majority were on foot. With blanched faces, bleeding bodies
and broken hearts, they fled from the Spectral Death they
thought was coming hard after, fled to the open spaces where
possibly its shadow might not fall. Soon Citadel Hill and the
Common were black with terrified thousands. Thousands more
trudged along St. Margaret's Bay road, seeking escape among
its trees and winding curves.... Many cut down boughs and
made themselves fires&mdash;for they were bitterly cold. Here they
were&mdash;poorly clad, badly wounded, and with not one loaf of
bread in all their number, so hastily did they leave, when galloping
horsemen announced the danger was over and it was safe
to return.<a name="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The ever-shifting responsiveness to rumor which distinguishes
a crowd was noted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The entrance to the Park was black with human beings, some
massed in groups, some running anxiously back and forth like
ants when their hill has been crushed. There were blanched
faces and trembling hands. The wildest rumors were in circulation
and every bearer of tidings was immediately surrounded.<a name="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not only here but when the crowd trekked back, and in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_44" title="44"> </a>
the subsequent scenes which were witnessed in supply stations
and shelters, the association which Sidis draws between
calamity and hyper-suggestibility in the body politic
was abundantly endorsed.</p>

<p>We must now endeavor to understand the phenomena of
emotion which accompany a great catastrophe. This is
not the less difficult because the term emotion is not given
consistent use even by psychologists. One interprets it
as merely the affective side of the instinctive process&mdash;those
&ldquo;modes of affective experience,&rdquo; such as &ldquo;anger, fear,
curiosity,&rdquo; which accompany the excitement of &ldquo;the principal
powerful instincts.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Another sees it as also an impulsive,
not merely a receptive state. It is &ldquo;the way the body
feels when it is prepared for a certain reaction,&rdquo; and includes
&ldquo;an impulse toward the particular reaction.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p>It will be accurate enough for our purpose to think of
the emotions as complicated states of feeling more or less
allied to one another and to the human will.<a name="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> Among them
are jealousy and envy&mdash;&ldquo;discomfort at seeing others approved
and at being out-done by them.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> This appeared
repeatedly in the administration of relief and should be included
in disaster psychology. Again greed<a name="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>&mdash;more strictly
a social instinct than an emotion&mdash;was common. How common
will receive further exemplification in a <a href="#Page_80">later chapter</a>.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_45" title="45"> </a>Fear has already been referred to. Anger, shame, resentment
while evident, were of less significance. Gratitude
was early shown and there were many formal expressions
of it. Later on, it seemed to be replaced by a feeling
that as sufferers they, the victims, were only receiving their
due in whatever aid was obtained.</p>

<p>Of special interest is the rôle of the tender emotions,
kindliness, sympathy and sorrow, as well as the reactions
which may be expected when these occur in unusual exaltation
through the repetition of stimuli or otherwise.
Whatever may be the nature of the process whereby the
feelings of his fellows affect a man, that which chiefly concerns
us here, is how these reactions differ when the stimulation
is multiplex. Of this multiplex stimulation in collective
psychology Graham Wallas has written:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The nervous exaltation so produced may be the effect of the
rapid repetition of stimuli acting as repetition acts, for instance,
when it produces seasickness or tickling.... If the exaltation is
extreme conscious control of feeling and action is diminished.<a name="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
Reaction is narrowed and men may behave, as they behave in
dreams, less rationally and morally than they do if the whole
of their nature is brought into play.<a name="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What Wallas has said of the additional stimulation which
the presence of a crowd induces may be given wider application,
and is indeed a most illuminating thought, describing
exactly the psycho-emotional reactions produced by the
stimulation of terrifying scenes, such as were witnessed at
Halifax.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_46" title="46"> </a>A case in point was that of the nervous exaltation produced
upon a young doctor who operated continuously for
many hours in the removal of injured eyes. The emotional
tension he went through is expressed in his words to a
witness: &ldquo;If relief doesn't come to me soon, I shall murder
somebody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Another instance where conscious control of feeling and
action was diminished was that of a soldier. He was so
affected by what he passed through during the explosion and
his two days' participation in relief work, that he quite unwittingly
took a seat in a train departing for Montreal.
Later in a hospital of that city after many mental wanderings
he recovered his memory. Over and over again he
had been picturing the dreadful scenes which he had experienced.
This condition includes a hyperactivity of the
imagination &ldquo;characterized by oneirism [oneiric delirium]
reproducing most often the tragic or terrible scenes which
immediately preceded the hypogenic shock.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The nature of sympathy<a name="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> may not be clearly comprehended
but of its effects there is no doubt. It may lead to
the relief of pain or induce the exactly opposite effect; or
it may bring about so lively a distress as to quite incapacitate
a man from giving help. Again it may lead to the avoidance
of disaster scenes altogether. Thus some could on no
account be prevailed upon to go into the hospitals or to enter
the devastated area. Others by a process understood in
the psychology of insanity secured the desired avoidance by
suicide. The association of suicide with catastrophe has
been already remarked in the case of San Francisco. A
Halifax instance was that of a physician who had labored
hard among the wounded. He later found the reaction of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_47" title="47"> </a>
his emotional experiences too strong. He lost his mental
balance and was discovered dead one morning near his
office door. He had hanged himself during the night.
Still another, a railroad man, driven to despair by loneliness
and loss, his wife and children having perished, attempted
to follow them in death.</p>

<p>Joy and sorrow are pleasure-pain conditions of emotional
states. Sorrow is painful because &ldquo;the impulse is baffled
and cannot attain more than the most scanty and imperfect
satisfaction in little acts, such as the leaving of flowers on
the grave;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> although the intensity is increased by
other considerations. Here again the unusual degree of
stimulation which catastrophe induces brings about a behavior
other than that which commonly attends the experience
of grief. A phenomenon associated with wholesale
bereavement is the almost entire absence of tears. A
witness of the San Francisco disaster said it was at the
end of the second day that he saw tears for the first time.<a name="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
At Halifax, where the loss of life was many times greater,
there was little crying. There seemed to be indeed a miserable
but strong consolation in the fact that all were alike
involved in the same calamity.<a name="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>There was &ldquo;no bitterness, no complaint, only a great and
eager desire to help some one less fortunate.&rdquo; Another
observer said: &ldquo;I have never seen such kindly feeling. I
have never seen such tender sympathy. I have never heard
an impatient word.&rdquo; And this was amongst men &ldquo;who were
covered with bruises, and whose hearts were heavy, who
have not had a night's sleep, and who go all day long without
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_48" title="48"> </a>
thought of food.&rdquo; Another visitor remarked &ldquo;there is
not a more courageous, sane and reasonable people. Everyone
is tender and considerate. Men who have lost wives
and children, women whose sons and husbands are dead,
boys and girls whose homes have been destroyed, are working
to relieve the distress.&rdquo; A Montreal clergyman reported
that &ldquo;Halifax people have been meeting with dry
eyes and calm faces the tragedies, the horrors, the sufferings
and the exposures which followed the explosion.&rdquo;
Grief is after all &ldquo;a passive emotion,&rdquo; a &ldquo;reaction of helplessness.&rdquo;
It is &ldquo;a state of mind appropriate to a condition
of affairs where nothing is to be done&rdquo;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> and there
was much to be done at Halifax.</p>

<p>There are also to be added the phenomena of emotional
parturition. As was to be expected the shock meant the
immediate provision of a maternity hospital. Babies were
born in cellars and among ruins. Premature births were
common, one indeed taking place in the midst of the huddled
thousands of refugees waiting in anguish upon the Common
for permission to return to their abandoned homes.
Nor were all the ills for which the shock was responsible
immediately discernible. There were many post-catastrophic
phenomena. Three months after the explosion many
found themselves suffering an inexplicable breakdown,
which the doctors attributed unquestionably to the catastrophe.
It was a condition closely allied to &ldquo;war-neurasthenia.&rdquo;
Another disaster after-effect also may be here recorded.
This was the not unnatural way in which people
&ldquo;lived on edge,&rdquo; for a long period after the disaster.
There was a readiness and suggestibility to respond to
rumor or to the least excitant. Twice at least the schools
were emptied precipitately, and citizens went forth into
pell-mell flight from their homes upon the circulation of
reports of possible danger. No better illustration is afforded
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_49" title="49"> </a>
of the sociological fact that &ldquo;the more expectant,
or overwrought the public mind, the easier it is to set up a
great perturbation. After a series of public calamities
.... minds are blown about by every gust of passion or
<ins title="sentiment.">sentiment.&rdquo;</ins><a name="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>There are also to be included a few miscellaneous observations
of behavior associated with the psychology of disaster
relief. (1) The preference upon the part of the
refugee for plural leadership and decision. (2) The aggravation
of helplessness through the open distribution of
relief. (3) The resentment which succeeds the intrusion
of strangers in relief leadership. (4) The reaction of
lassitude and depression after a period of strain. (5) The
desire for privacy during interviews. (6) The vital importance
of prompt decision in preventing an epidemic of
complaint.<a name="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>Analytic psychology is becoming increasingly interested
in the phenomena of repression, inhibition and taboo.
The real motives of action are often very different
from the apparent motives which overlie them. Instinctive
tendencies are buried beneath barriers of civilization,
but they are buried alive. They are covered not crushed.
These resistances are either within our minds or in society.
The latter are summed up in conventionality, custom and
law, all so relatively recent<a name="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> in time as to supply a very
thin veneer over the primitive tendencies which have held
sway for ages. Few realize the place which conventionality,
custom and law possess in a community until in some
extraordinary catastrophe their power is broken, or what
is the same thing the ability to enforce them is paralyzed.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_50" title="50"> </a>
This fact is especially true of repressive enactments, and
most laws fall within this category. Catastrophe shatters
the unsubstantial veneer. When the police of Boston went
on strike it was not only the signal for the crooks of all
towns to repair to the unguarded center, but an unexpected
reserve of crookedness came to light within the city itself.
Lytton discovered at Pompeii signs of plunder and sacrilege
which had taken place &ldquo;when the pillars of the world tottered
to and fro.&rdquo; At the time of the St. John Fire
&ldquo;loafers and thieves held high carnival. All night long they
roamed the streets and thieved upon the misfortunes of
others.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>With the possibility of apprehension reduced to a minimum
in the confusion at Halifax, with the deterrent forces
of respectability and law practically unknown, men appeared
for what they were as the following statement only
too well discloses:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Few folk thought that Halifax harbored any would-be ghouls
or vultures. The disaster showed how many. Men clambered
over the bodies of the dead to get beer in the shattered breweries.
Men taking advantage of the flight from the city because
of the possibility of another explosion went into houses and
shops, and took whatever their thieving fingers could lay hold
of. Then there were the nightly prowlers among the ruins,
who rifled the pockets of the dead and dying, and snatched
rings from icy fingers. A woman lying unconscious on the
street had her fur coat snatched from her back.... One of
the workers, hearing some one groaning rescued a shop-keeper
from underneath the debris. Unearthing at the same time a
cash box containing one hundred and fifty dollars, he gave it
to a young man standing by to hold while he took the victim
to a place of refuge. When he returned the box was there,
but the young man and the money had disappeared.</p>

<p>Then there was the profiteering phase. Landlords raised
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_51" title="51"> </a>their rents upon people in no position to bear it. The Halifax
Trades and Labor Council adopted a resolution urging that
the Mayor be authorized to request all persons to report landlords
who &ldquo;have taken advantage of conditions created by the
explosion.&rdquo; ... Plumbers refused to hold their union rules
in abeyance and to work one minute beyond the regular eight
hours unless they received their extra rates for overtime; and
the bricklayers assumed a dog-in-the-manger attitude and refused
to allow the plasterers to help in the repair of the
chimneys. And this during days of dire stress ... when
many men and women were working twelve and fourteen hours
a day without a cent or thought of remuneration. One
Halifax newspaper spoke of these men as &ldquo;squeezing the uttermost
farthing out of the anguished necessities of the homeless
men, women and children.&rdquo; Truckmen charged exorbitant
prices for the transferring of goods and baggage. Merchants
boosted prices. A small shopkeeper asked a little starving child
thirty cents for a loaf of bread.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, December the twelfth, the Deputy Mayor issued
a proclamation warning persons so acting that they would be
dealt with under the provisions of the law.<a name="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Slowly the arm of repression grew vigorous once more.
The military placed troops on patrol. Sentries were posted
preventing entrance to the ruins to those who were not
supplied with a special pass. Orders were issued to shoot
any looter trying to escape. The Mayor's proclamation, the
warning of the relief committee, the storm of popular indignation
gradually became effectual.</p>

<p>The stimulus of the same catastrophe, it thus appears,
may result in two different types of responses&mdash;that of
greed on the one hand or altruistic emotion on the other.
One individual is spurred to increased activity by the opportunity
of business profit, another by the sense of social
needs. Why this is so&mdash;indeed the whole field of profiteering&mdash;would
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_52" title="52"> </a>
be a subject of interesting enquiry. Whether it
is due to the varying degrees of socialization represented
in the different individuals or whether it is not also partly
due to the fact that philanthropy functions best in a sphere
out of line with a man's own particular occupation, the
truth remains that some display an altogether unusual type
of reaction in an emergency to the actions of others; and
perhaps exhibit behavior quite different from that which
appears normal in a realm of conduct where associations
based on habit are so strongly ingrained.</p>

<p>The human will as we have seen is in close association
with the emotions. We are now to notice the dynamogenic
value of the strong emotions aroused by catastrophe. It is
first of all essential to remember the rôle of adrenin in
counteracting the effects of fatigue. Wonderful phenomena
of endurance in disaster might well be anticipated for
&ldquo;adrenin set free in pain and in fear and in rage would
put the members of the body unqualifiedly at the disposal
of the nervous system.&rdquo; This is &ldquo;living on one's will&rdquo; or
on &ldquo;one's nerve.&rdquo; There are &ldquo;reservoirs&rdquo; of power ready
to pour forth streams of energy if the occasion presents itself.
Strong emotions may become an &ldquo;arsenal of augmented
strength.&rdquo; This fact William James was quick to
see when he said &ldquo;on any given day there are energies
slumbering within us which the incitements of that day do
not call forth.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> But it was left to Cannon to unfold the
physiological reasons,<a name="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and for Woodworth to explain how
the presence of obstruction has power to call forth new
energies.<a name="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Indeed the will<a name="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> is just the inner driving force
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_53" title="53"> </a>
of the individual and an effort of will is only &ldquo;the development
of fresh motor power.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Following the lines of least
resistance the will experiences no unusual exercise.
Catastrophe opposes the tendency to eliminate from life
everything that requires a calling forth of unusual energies.</p>

<p>The energizing influence of an emotional excitant was
shown at Halifax in the remarkable way in which sick
soldiers abandoned their beds and turned them over to the
victims rushed to the military hospitals. It was seen again
in the sudden accession of strength displayed by the invalids
and the infirm during the hurried evacuation of the
houses&mdash;a behavior like that of the inhabitants of Antwerp
during the bombardment of that city in October 1914, when
those who fled to Holland showed extraordinary resistance
to fatigue.<a name="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The resistance to fatigue and suffering received
more abundant illustration at Halifax in the work of
rescue and relief. Often men themselves were surprised at
their own power for prolonged effort and prodigious strain
under the excitement of catastrophe. It was only on Monday
(the fifth day) that collapses from work began to appear.
Among the more generally known instances of unusual endurance
was that of a private, who with one of his eyes
knocked out, continued working the entire day of the disaster.
Another was that of a chauffeur who with a broken
rib conveyed the wounded trip after trip to the hospital,
only relinquishing the work when he collapsed. An unknown
man was discovered at work in the midst of the ruins
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_54" title="54"> </a>
although his own face was half blown off. Those who escaped
with lesser injuries worked day and night while the
crisis lasted. Many did not go home for days, so manifold
and heavy were the tasks. There was no pause for
comment. Conversation was a matter of nods and silent
signs, the direction of an index finger. Weeks later the
workers were surprised to find themselves aged and thin.
The excitement, the stimulus of an overwhelming need had
banished all symptoms of fatigue. During the congestion
which followed the arrival of the relief trains there were
men who spent seventy-two hours with scarcely any rest
or sleep. One of the telephone terminal room staff stuck
to his post for ninety-two hours, probably the record case
of the disaster for endurance under pressure. Magnificent
effort, <ins title="conspicious">conspicuous</ins> enough for special notice was the work
of the search parties who, facing bitterest cold and in the
midst of blinding storms, continued their work of rescue;
and the instance of the business girls who in the same
weather worked for many hours with bottles of hot water
hung about their waists. An effect which could not <ins title="escape,">escape</ins>
observation was the strange insensibility to suffering
on the part of many of the victims themselves. Men,
women and little children endured the crudest operations
without experiencing the common effects of pain. They
seemed to have been anaesthetized by the general shock.
Sidewalk operations, the use of common thread for sutures,
the cold-blooded extracting of eyes were carried on often
without a tremor. This resistance to suffering was due
not only to the increase of energy already described but also
to the fact that the prostrating effect of pain is largely relative
to the diversion of attention,&mdash;as &ldquo;headaches disappear
promptly upon the alarm of fire&rdquo; and &ldquo;toothaches
vanish at the moment of a burglar's scare.&rdquo; Much pain is
due to the super-sensitivity of an area through hyperaemia,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_55" title="55"> </a>
or increased blood supply, following concentrated attention.
Thus it is actually possible by volition to control
the spread of pain, and the therapeutic virtues of an
electric shock or a slap in the face are equally demonstrable.
This reasoning is also applicable to the absence of sympathetic
reactions among many disaster workers. They were
found often to be &ldquo;curiously detached and not greatly
moved by the distressing scenes in morgue, in hospital, in
the ruins and at the inquiry stations.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p>Catastrophe and the sudden termination of the normal
which ensues become the stimuli of heroism and bring
into play the great social virtues of generosity and of kindliness&mdash;which,
in one of its forms, is mutual aid. The new
conditions, perhaps it would be more correct to say, afford
the occasion for their release. It is said that battle does
to the individual what the developing solution does to the
photographic plate,&mdash;brings out what is in the man. This
may also be said of catastrophe. Every community has its
socialized individuals, the dependable, the helpful, the considerate,
as well as the &ldquo;non-socialized survivors of
savagery,&rdquo; who are distributed about the zero point of the
social scale. Calamity is the occasion for the discovery of
the &ldquo;presence of extraordinary individuals in a group.&rdquo;
The relation of them to a crisis is one of the most important
points in the problem of progress.</p>

<p>At Halifax there were encountered many such individuals
as well as families who refused assistance that others might
be relieved. Individual acts of finest model were written
ineffaceably upon the social memory of the inhabitants.
There was the case of a child who released with her teeth
the clothes which held her mother beneath a pile of debris.
A wounded girl saved a large family of children, getting
them all out of a broken and burning home. A telegraph
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_56" title="56"> </a>
operator at the cost of his life stuck to his key, sent a warning
message over the line and stopped an incoming train in
the nick of time.</p>

<p>Group heroism was no less remarkable. For the flooding
of the powder magazine in the naval yard an entire
battery volunteered. This was why the second explosion
did not actually occur. Freight handlers too, as well as
soldiers, revealed themselves possessors of the great spirit.
A conspicuous case was that of the longshoremen working
on board of a ship laden with explosives. Fully realizing the
impending danger, because of the nearness of the burning
munitioner, they used what precious minutes of life remained
them to protect their own ship's explosives from
ignition. A fire did afterwards start upon the ship but
a brave captain loosed her from the pier, and himself extinguished
the blaze which might soon have repeated in part
the devastations already wrought.</p>

<p>No disaster psychology should omit a discussion of the
psychology of helpfulness&mdash;that self-help to which the best
relief workers always appeal, as well as of the mutual aid
upon which emergency relief must largely depend. Mutual
aid while not a primary social fact is inherent in the association
of members of society, as it also &ldquo;obtains among cells
and organs of the vital organism.&rdquo; As it insured survival
in the earlier stages of evolution<a name="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> so it reveals itself when
survival is again threatened by catastrophe.</p>

<p>The illustrations of mutual aid at Halifax would fill a
volume. Not only was it evidenced in the instances of
families and friends but also in the realm of business.
Cafés served lunches without charge. Drug stores gave
out freely of their supplies. Firms released their clerks
to swell the army of relief. A noteworthy case of community
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_57" title="57"> </a>
service was that of the Grocers' Guild announcing
that its members would</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="no-indent">fill no orders for outside points during the crisis, that they
would coöperate with the relief committee in delivering foodstuffs
free of charge to any point in the city, and that their
stocks were at the disposal of the committee at the actual cost
to them.<a name="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">By incidents such as these, Halifax gained the appellation
of the City of Comrades.</p>

<p>Catastrophe becomes also the excitant for an unparalleled
opening of the springs of generosity.<a name="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Communication
has transformed mutual aid into a term of worldwide significance.
As at San Francisco, when from all directions
spontaneous gifts were hurried to the stricken city, when in
a period of three months seventeen hundred carloads and
five steamerloads of relief goods arrived, in addition to
millions of cash contributions, so was it at Halifax. So
it has always been, as is proven by Chicago, Dayton,
Chelsea as well as by numbers of other instances. The
public heart responds with instantaneous and passionate
sympathy. Halifax specials were on every railroad. Ships
brought relief by sea. Cities vied with each other in their
responses. Every hour brought telegraphed assistance from
governments and organizations. In about fifteen weeks
approximately eight millions had been received, aside from
the Federal grant. But it was not the totality of the gifts,
but the number of the givers which gives point to our study.
So many rushed with their donations to the Calvin Austin
before she sailed from Boston on her errand of relief that
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_58" title="58"> </a>
&ldquo;the police reserves were called out to preserve order.&rdquo; A
great mass of the contributions involved much personal
sacrifice upon the part of the contributors, as accompanying
letters testified. It could be written of Halifax as it
was of San Francisco that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="no-indent">all the fountains of good fellowship, of generosity, of sympathy,
of good cheer, pluck and determination have been opened wide
by the common downfall. The spirit of all is a marvelous
revelation of the good and fine in humanity, intermittent or

<p class="no-indent">Abridged and sketchy as the foregoing necessarily is, it is
perhaps full enough to have at least outlined the social
phenomena of the major sort which a great disaster presents.
These are found to be either abnormal and handicapping,
such as, emotional parturition; or stimulative and promotive,
such as the dynamogenic reactions. In propositional form
it may be stated that catastrophe is attended by <ins title="phenonema">phenomena</ins>
of social psychology, which may either retard or promote
social organization.</p>

<p>In addition this chapter has discussed the rôle of catastrophe
in stimulating community service, in presenting models
of altruistic conduct, in translating energy into action, in
defending law and order, and in bringing into play the great
social virtues of generosity, sympathy and mutual aid.</p>

<p class="hanging-indent">The organization of relief&mdash;The disaster protocracy&mdash;The transition
from chaos through leadership&mdash;Vital place of communication&mdash;Utility
of association&mdash;Imitation&mdash;Social pressure&mdash;Consciousness of
kind&mdash;Discussion&mdash;Circumstantial pressure&mdash;Climate&mdash;Geographic determinants&mdash;Classification
of factors.</p>

<p>We have seen something of the disintegration which
followed what has been called the &ldquo;stun of the explosion.&rdquo;
It included the abrupt flight from, and the emptying of, all
the houses and centers of employment, the division of
families in the haste of the running and the rescue, and the
utter helplessness of thousands in the three basic necessities
of life&mdash;food, raiment and a roof. There was the dislocation
of transportation, the disorganization of business, and the
problem of unemployment aggravated because not only was
the work gone, but also with it the will to work.</p>

<p>Social organization comes next in order and because its
process was associated with the organization of relief&mdash;the
first social activity&mdash;the sociological factors observed in the
latter call for descriptive treatment. When the human
organism receives an accident to one of its parts, automatic
relief processes from within spring at once into being, and
it is so with the body politic. This &ldquo;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis medicatrix
naturae</i>&rdquo; assumes sovereign power over all the resources
of the community. That part of the social sensorium which
is most closely organized in normal hours, first recovers
consciousness in disaster. In the case of Halifax it was
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_60" title="60"> </a>
the army. So was it in San Francisco, and in Chelsea.
The army has the intensive concentration, the discipline,
the organization and often the resource of supplies instantly
available. Its training is of the kind for the endurance of
shock.<a name="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> It so happened that at Halifax large numbers of
men in uniform were stationed where they could quickly
respond to call. They were very soon under orders. The
military authorities realized before midday, the part which
the army should play. The firemen too were a social group
which largely remained organized, and responded to the
general alarm soon after the explosion. Their chief and
deputy-chief had been instantly killed so they were leaderless,
until one of the city controllers assumed command, and
in spite of the wild exodus when the alarm of a second explosion
spread, these men remained at their posts.</p>

<p>Play actors also display similar traits of collective behavior.
They are accustomed to think quickly, to live in
restricted spaces, and to meet emergencies. Than the stage
there is no better school. Each actor does his or her part
and it alone. The Academy Stock Company, forsaking the
school of Thespis for that of Esculapius, organized the
first relief station established at Halifax. This was in
operation about noon on the day of the disaster.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that the soldiers, firemen and play
actors may be called the disaster protocracy.<a name="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> They were
&ldquo;the alert and effective,&rdquo; the most promptly reacting units
in emergency. And it would appear that the part of
society which is most closely organized and disciplined in
normal periods first recovers social consciousness in disaster.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_61" title="61"> </a>It is the events of the first few hours which are of
special interest to the sociologist. The word most descriptive
of the first observable phenomenon was leadership. The
soldiers were foremost in the work of rescue, of warning,
of protection, of transportation and of food distribution.
But the earliest leadership that could be called social, arising
from the public itself, was that on the part of those who
had no family ties, much of the earliest work being done
by visitors in the city. The others as a rule ran first to their
homes to discover if their own families were in danger.
From this body in a short while however many came forward
to join in the activities of relief.</p>

<p>As already said those with no social, family or property
ties were among the first to begin relief work. But many
of these started early simply because they were present
where need arose. Many indeed of the uninjured folk at
a distance seemed unable to realize the terribleness of the
immediate need in the stricken area. In fact, owing to the
collapse of communication they did not for an appreciable
time discover that there was an area more stricken than
their own, and devoted themselves to cleaning up glass and
the like. But within a quarter of an hour a hospital ship
had sent ashore two landing parties with surgeons and
emergency kits. With almost equal dispatch the passengers
of an incoming train&mdash;the railroad terminal at the time
being in the north end of the city&mdash;were on hand, and were
among the earliest first-aid workers. One, a Montreal man,
was known individually to have rendered first aid to at
least a half hundred of the wounded.</p>

<p>It was early afternoon, perhaps five hours after the
catastrophe, when a semblance of coöperative action in
rescue work began. Previous to this the work had been done
in a rapid and random fashion, a single ruin being dug
through a second or even a third time. Then came the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_62" title="62"> </a>
recognition of the utility of association.<a name="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> Thereafter the
searchers became parties each of which was detailed to go
over a definite area. When a particular section had been
covered it was so recorded. This process considerably expedited
the work in hand. Meanwhile relief was organized
in other important directions.</p>

<p>The vital place of communication in society was recognized
at once. It is a major influence in association, and
upon it in disaster depends the immediacy as well as the
adequacy of relief. Connections had been cut by the explosion
and the outside world could only wait and wonder.
How little real information filtered through is shown by
the fact that at Truro, only sixty-two miles distant, the announcement
was made three hours after the explosion that
the death roll would not bear more than fifty names.
Nevertheless within an hour after the explosion a telegraph
company had a single line established, and with news of
the disaster, communities everywhere took up the rôle of
the Samaritan.</p>

<p>While the great hegira was in progress another leader,
a railroad official, drove rapidly out the Bedford Road and
commandeered the first unbroken wire to Moncton. Thereafter
all that the government railroad equipment could do
was at the community's service. Meanwhile the dislocated
railroad yards were being combed for a live engine and
coaches in commission. A hospital train was put together
and in less than four hours after the explosion a large
number of injured people were being transported to Truro.</p>

<p>Even before the rushing of the wounded to the hospitals
a few began to realize the great human needs which would
soon be manifest among the concourse of thousands who
waited in helpless suspense upon the Common and the hill.
Here they were <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en masse</i>, a typical social aggregation, responding
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_63" title="63"> </a>
to the primitive, gregarious instinct of the herd.
&ldquo;Like sheep they had flocked together too bewildered for
consecutive thought.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Yet here ministrations of one sort
or another came into spontaneous operation. Soon the
military began raising white tents upon the field. One
after another they rose, presenting the appearance of an huge
encampment. The idea spread by imitation,<a name="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> the repetition
of a model,&mdash;&ldquo;the imitative response of many minds to
the suggestive invention of one.&rdquo; One or two here and one
or two there began to prepare the big church halls and
other roomy institutional buildings for occupancy. Hastily
the windows were patched up, the glass swept out, and no
sooner had the danger of a second explosion passed, and the
rumor of a possible roof reached the homeless, than
they began to repair thither. At first each improvised shelter
became a miniature clothing and food depot <ins title="at">as</ins> well as a
habitation. Then the idea spread of taking the refugees into
such private homes as had fared less badly. Imitation is the
foundation of custom. It became the thing to do. The
thing to do is social pressure. It may be unwilled and unintended
but it is inexorable. It worked effectively upon
all who had an unused room. Many sheltered upwards of
a dozen for weeks; some, more.</p>

<p>In the homes and shelters association of the like-minded
soon came about through consciousness of kind. At first
it was a very general consciousness which seemed to draw
all together into a fellowship of suffering as victims of a
common calamity. There was neither male nor female, just
nor unjust, bond nor free. Men, women and little children
lay side by side in the large sleeping rooms and
&ldquo;shared each other's woes,&rdquo; for &ldquo;the consciousness of
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_64" title="64"> </a>
kind allays fear and engenders <ins title="comradeship.">comradeship.&rdquo;</ins><a name="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Then followed
requests for changes of location in the dormitories,
and for changes of seats at the dining tables. As various
shelters sprang up, the religious element appeared. Applications
came for transfers from Roman Catholic institutions
to Protestant stations and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vice versa</i>. Even the
politically congenial were only too ready to segregate when
occasion offered.</p>

<p>Discussion and agreement must precede all wise concerted
volition. There must be &ldquo;common discussion of
common action.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Propositions must be &ldquo;put forth&rdquo; and
talked over. There must be a &ldquo;meeting of minds&rdquo; and a
&ldquo;show of hands,&rdquo; and decisions made. There had been
no preparedness. The city possessed not even a paper
organization for such a contingency as a sudden disaster;
so that during the most precious hours citizens and civic
officials had to consult and map out a program as best
the circumstances allowed. It was late afternoon on the
day of the disaster when a tentative plan had been formulated
in the City Hall. The newly formed committees
could do but little until the following dawn.</p>

<p>Men at best are largely creatures of circumstance. Innumerable
causes, small and great, conspire to incite social
action. But in catastrophe the control of circumstantial
pressure<a name="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> becomes almost sovereign in extent. The conditions
it brings about, while often delaying measures of individual
relief, account very largely for the rapidity of
organization. While they limit they also provoke effort.
The common danger constrains great numbers to &ldquo;overlook
many differences, to minimize many of their antagonisms
and to combine their efforts.&rdquo; At Halifax the pressure
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_65" title="65"> </a>
of indescribable suffering precipitated the medical and
hospital arrangements which were the earliest forms of
communal service. But it was the meteorological conditions
which commanded the most prompt attention to the
consideration of shelter and clothing. The months appeared
to have lost station and February to have come out
of season. The following table gives the weather record for
the seven days which followed the catastrophe.<a name="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> It is the

<p>In consequence of otherwise unendurable conditions, the
most rapid repairs were made to all habitable houses or
those possible of being made so. The same was true of
public buildings, hospitals, factories and warehouses.
Moreover the same explanation accounts for the exodus of
many who sought for shelter to the countryside nearby; and
the many more who accepted the invitation of, and entrained
for various Nova Scotian towns which became veritable
&ldquo;cities of refuge&rdquo; to hundreds. The climate<a name="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> decided
the question of reconstruction in favor of temporary structures;
for it was a time of year when prompt rebuilding
was out of the question. Climatic conditions also seriously
delayed the arrival of relief supplies, allowed but scanty
provision for many, kept some from the depots of relief,
or from surgical aid; and others standing in line in the
bitter cold. It also added seriously to the sanitation and
shelter problem. But it speeded and spurred the workers
to prevent the maximum of exposure and neglect. It called
imperatively for the most effective system, and many
of the workable methods were hit upon under the stress of
storm. An illustration of this may be found in the adoption
of many food depots instead of one central station.
Regional influence thus &ldquo;fixes the possibilities of organization
and collective effectiveness.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> The sociologist must
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_67" title="67"> </a>
study maps of lands and plans of cities. The location
of the food stations at Halifax was a matter of topography
as were the later administration districts. The city is
widely spread out. It has fifty more miles of street than
a city of similar population in a neighboring province. Six
depots were established for the public distribution of supplies,<a name="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
situated so as to touch the entire needy population
most effectively, and to equalize the groups to some degree.
So too, in the matter of dressing stations, accessibility was
a deciding factor. But even this system had to be supplemented.
Bread vans were driven hither and thither and when
halted in the center of a street were usually immediately
surrounded. Thus social reorganization in catastrophe
witnesses to an urgency resident no less in space than in
time and reëmphasizes the importance placed upon the
physical factors in sociology.</p>

<p>Thus may be said to have come about the transition from
chaos to a semblance of community organization. Not the
normal civil social order of pre-disaster days, but the establishment
of a species of collective behavior, and the organization
of relationships apparently of a quite different
character. The difference was one which might be compared
to that between a great relief camp and a city. But
the difference was only superficial. Fundamentally there
were to be seen the factors underlying all social organization.
These have been already illustrated, and are classified
as psychological, such as leadership, gregarious instinct,
imitation, consciousness of kind, discussion, recognition of
utility of association and custom; and as physical, including
climate and topography.<a name="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The conclusion was drawn
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_68" title="68"> </a>
that the part of society which is most closely organized and
disciplined in normality, first recovers consciousness in
catastrophe, and the value of a militia organization in every
community is a practical corollary. This follows not only
because of the imperturbability and the promptitude of
reaction, of an army in crisis, but also because of the
rapidity with which it can be mobilized, its value in preserving
law and order, its authoritative control and power to
punish, and because of the attending psychological effects
of orderly bearing and coolness in a time of general chaos,
bespeaking a care that is at once paternal and sympathetic.</p>

<small><span class="small-caps">Catastrophe and Social Organization</span> (Cont'd)</small></h2>

<p class="hanging-indent">The reorganization of the civil social order&mdash;Division of labor&mdash;Resumption
of normal activities&mdash;State and voluntary associations&mdash;Order
of reëstablishment&mdash;Effects of environmental change&mdash;The
play of imitation&mdash;The stimulus of lookers-on&mdash;Social conservation.</p>

<p><span class="small-caps">It</span> is not necessary to repeat the fact, which the reader
has already seen, that the process of complete social organization
was largely expedited by the organization of relief,
and materially reacted upon by it. The community's &ldquo;big
men,&rdquo; the men of prominence, the men of broad experience
in civic and philanthropic work, the men who knew the resources
of the city and had the prestige to command them,
were deeply immersed in the relief work while the businesses
and the departments of the shattered body politic waited or
went forward in a more or less indifferent way.</p>

<p>But this could be both economically and socially of a
temporary nature only. &ldquo;Business and industry must be
set agoing. Church and school must resume the ordinary
routine. One by one the broken threads of the former
everyday life, the life of custom and habit must be reconnected.&rdquo;
The division of social labor<a name="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> is a law of
society. It is traceable back to the primitive household
itself, and is a result of underlying differences. The
great &ldquo;cause which determines the manner by which work
is divided is diversity of capacity.&rdquo; With the advent of the
social specialists at Halifax a major division of function
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_70" title="70"> </a>
began. The responsibility for the relief work having been
delegated to a special social group, public thought and
public men were free to turn their energies to the restoration
of a normal society.</p>

<p>But it was the reorganization rather than the organization
of relations which the sociologist observes to have first
taken place. The stage was all laid. It was necessary only
for the actors in the drama to resume their places. The
old &ldquo;parts&rdquo; awaited them, although many of the &ldquo;properties&rdquo;
were no more. Or to use the more sociological jargon
one might say, there was still the homogeneity of stock,
still a dominating like-mindedness, still a protocracy, still
a group of mores to serve as media of social self-control.
Indeed most of the former complexities of social structure
remained. But this was only potentially true. The social
relations based upon the underlying factors had to be resumed.
Moreover the resumption was accompanied by various changes
the significance of which will appear in later discussion.
The order of the resumption of normal activities is of unusual
social interest as are also the influences which were in play
and the changes which ensued. It may be objected that
such a tabulation is unfair to the various socially component
groups and that the special exigencies of each preclude
comparison. But at least one index of the bent of the
social mind is the separation of those activities which must
needs be first rehabilitated, from those which can wait.
Organizing genius was not entirely occupied with relief in
the ordinary sense of the term.</p>

<p>Economic vigor is one of the most vital things in a community's
life. It is in a sense fundamental not only to
happiness and general well-being but accompanies and conditions
the cultural institutions, religious, educational and
aesthetic. It is not surprising then that commercial activity
was in actual fact the earliest aspect of life to resume a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_71" title="71"> </a>
semblance of normality. Naturally public utilities were
first on the list, for these include systems of communication
without which society can hardly be. Reference has already
been made to the speed with which a makeshift service
was established, but our purpose here is to record the resumption
of normal activity.</p>

<p>Wire communication is led out from the city by pole lines.
Many of these had been demolished, or broken at the crossbeam.
Clerks had been injured and instruments damaged.
In spite of these odds one was reconnected within an hour,
and by the evening of the day of the disaster six direct
multiplex wires to Montreal, three to St. John and one each
to Boston and New York, had been established. Upwards
of a thousand messages an hour went forth the first week.
The work became normal about December twentieth.</p>

<p>The telephone system suffered the loss of the entire northern
exchange and of the harbor cable&mdash;broken through ships
dragging anchor&mdash;a total material damage of one hundred
thousand dollars. Its personnel was also depleted. Nevertheless
telephone business may be said to have been generally
resumed on the seventh, the day after the disaster, and the
load of local traffic soon attained over one hundred and
twenty percent above its average figure. Telephone service
was absolutely suspended for only about two hours,&mdash;the
period of prohibition from buildings,&mdash;and the cable telephone
for about three days. Messages of a social character
were tabooed for several weeks, when the work again became
normal.</p>

<p>The illumination service was quickly restored. The
company was able to give partial light and some service
from noon on the sixth. Periods of intermittent darkness
however, were not unusual. Gas service was off until December
the ninth&mdash;the top of the gasometer having been
broken and two hundred thousand cubic feet deflected from
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_72" title="72"> </a>
the mains into the air&mdash;when repairs were completed and on
the tenth the service resumed. On the fourteenth gas and
electric light service became normal.</p>

<p>Railroad communication had been dislocated. The explosion
occurred in the vicinity of the principal sidings and
vital portions of the system. Three miles of the main
road were buried in debris, the station wrecked, equipment
damaged, and crews scattered searching for their dead.
In spite of this, as already noted, a hospital train was sent
out in the early afternoon of the disaster day and incoming
trains were switched to their new tracks leading to the
south end terminal. On the evening of the day following
the disaster&mdash;Friday&mdash;the first regular train for Montreal
left the city. Two days later the main lines were clear
and the first train left the old passenger station on
Saturday evening. By Monday the full passenger service
was resumed, to and from the station. Eight days after
the catastrophe all branches of the service were working
and conditions were fairly normal.</p>

<p>The rolling stock of the street-car system sustained much
damage. Some of the employees were injured and others
were unavailable. A scant service was restored at noon on
December the sixth. By six o'clock of the seventh, tram
lines in the north section were able to resume an eight-car
service. Then the blizzard came and tied up all lines. It
was not until Sunday, December ninth, that it was possible
to resume any semblance of car service. On the twenty-second
of December, twenty-two cars were operating&mdash;twenty-seven
is the normal number,&mdash;but the shortage of
men made it difficult to operate the full number. The
service was not entirely normal for some months owing to
the severe storms all winter which tied up the lines and
caused delays, and to the shortage of men to handle the cars.</p>

<p>The newspaper offices by the employment of hand compositors
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_73" title="73"> </a>
were able to produce papers on December seventh
but in limited editions and of reduced size. This was
owing to the dependency of the linotypes upon the gas
service which had failed. The normal-size production recommenced
in a week's time.<a name="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>

<p>The postal service was completely disorganized and was
not restored to any extent until Monday the tenth of December.
Owing to the innumerable changes of address, as
well as many other reasons, it was weeks before there was
a normal and reliable distribution of mails.</p>

<p>The banks were open for business the morning following
the catastrophe, just as soon as the doors and windows were
put in. Traffic of relief trains coming in affected the
ordinary trade for three months, more or less, but principally
outside of the city. In the city all business in the
banks went on as usual the day after the explosion.</p>

<p>Two instances are selected at random to illustrate the
resumption of general business activity. Out of much
wreckage and a forty-thousand-dollar loss one company
restarted paint and varnish making on January second. A
large clothing establishment, had been badly damaged. The
factory and all branches of the business were running in
five weeks&mdash;January tenth. Machines were in operation with
shortened staffs at an earlier date.</p>

<p>The regular meetings of the City Council recommenced
on December twentieth, and were held regularly from that
time on. The Board of Trade rooms were not badly
damaged and there was no cessation of work or meetings.
The theatres were speedily repaired and resumed business
on Friday, December the twenty-eighth. The Citizen's
Library was a few weeks closed for the circulation of books,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_74" title="74"> </a>
and used in relief service as a food depot, thus ministering
to a hunger which is more imperious than that of mind in
the hour of catastrophe.</p>

<p>Of the churches several were entirely destroyed. In all
cases the edifices were injured, organs disordered and windows
shattered. Parishes were in some instances almost
wiped out. In a single congregation four hundred and four
perished. In another nearly two hundred were killed, the
remainder losing their property. In a third, of the one
hundred and eight houses represented in the congregation
only fourteen were left standing. Hurried efforts were
made to safeguard church property, but church services were
not generally resumed until the second Sunday.<a name="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Even
then the congregations were small and the worshipping-places
were not in all cases churches. Theatres, halls and
other buildings housed many a religious gathering. While
the restoration of churches waited, clergy and church
workers gave themselves unremittingly to the relief of the
needy, the succor of the injured and the burial of the dead.
Their intimate knowledge of family conditions was of inestimable
value in the relief administration. Sunday
schools were reassembled as accommodations permitted, but
it was many months before the attendances approximated
the normal.</p>

<p>The school system was badly disorganized. Three
buildings were totally destroyed, and all were rendered uninhabitable
for some time. The loss was approximately
eight-hundred thousand dollars. The members of the staff
were given over to relief committees, registration, nursing
and clothing service. Early in March, about three months
after the explosion, arrangements were completed whereby
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_75" title="75"> </a>
nearly all the children in the city could attend classes. The
double-session system was introduced to accomplish this.
Rooms were necessarily over-crowded and ventilation impaired.
By May eighth, fifteen school buildings were in
use.<a name="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>The community as finally reorganized differed materially
from that which had preceded. The picture of the
conditions at a considerably later period will be fully presented
elsewhere. Here will be noted only a few social
effects immediately apparent and due to the temporary environmental
conditions.</p>

<p>Owing to the number of men required for reconstruction
work the Tramway Company found it very difficult to get
a full complement of men back into the service. As a result
they took into consideration the advisability of employing
women conductors, and finally adopted this plan.</p>

<p>At the time of the explosion a heated election campaign
was in progress. Then representative men of both political
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_76" title="76"> </a>
parties urged their followers to drop the election fight and
the election was deferred and later rendered unnecessary
by the withdrawal of one of the candidates.</p>

<p>The darkening of the water-front, the shading of windows,
and other war-protective measures against the
submarine menace, were given little attention for many
weeks, and the coming into operation of the Military Service
Act was postponed.</p>

<p>The establishment of relief stations, and later, of the
temporary relief houses in the central and southern portion
of the city brought about a very unusual commingling of
classes, as well as a readjustment of membership in schools,
parishes and various institutions.</p>

<p>Club life, social life, lodge and society &ldquo;evenings&rdquo; were
for a considerable period tabooed, because of a general
sentiment against enjoyment under the existing conditions
as well as to lack of accommodation and of time.</p>

<p>The clamor for arrests, for the fixing of responsibility
for the disaster, and for the meting out of punishment was
for a long time in evidence, but never received complete
satisfaction.</p>

<p>The difficulties of restoration of school attendance repeated
the experience of the Cherry disaster, and the Truant
Officer had a very strenuous time owing to the fact that so
many people had changed their addresses.</p>

<p>A number of &ldquo;special policemen&rdquo; were recruited from
citizens of all ranks, and this force materially assisted the
members of the regular department. Owing to the large
influx of workmen following the catastrophe, as well as
for other reasons the work of the detectives was greatly
increased.<a name="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>The survivors of two neighboring congregations, although
belonging to different denominations, united in erecting a
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_77" title="77"> </a>
temporary church building&mdash;their respective churches having
been destroyed&mdash;and have since worshipped together&mdash;a
demonstration of the practicability of church union under
circumstantial pressure.</p>

<p>The display apartments of a furniture concern were
utilized as actual living rooms by refugees for a period,
while at the same time business was in operation throughout
the rest of the establishment.</p>

<p>The necessary functioning of relief activities, seven days
in the week, the keeping of stores open on Sundays and the
general disorganization of the parishes was reflected for a
long period in a changed attitude upon the part of many
towards Sabbath observance.</p>

<p>German residents of the city were immediately placed
under arrest when the disaster occurred, but all were later
given their freedom.</p>

<p>The citizens of Halifax were almost entirely oblivious
to the progress of the war and other matters of world interest,
for many days after the disaster.</p>

<p>The reversion to the use of candles, oil lamps and lanterns
was an interesting temporary effect.</p>

<p>The rapidity of the reorganization, as well as the subsequent
expansion, noted later, was largely effected by the
social law of imitation already noticed. Many of the conditions
affecting the rate of imitation were present. There
was a crisis, there was necessity, there was trade and business
advantage, social pressure, public demand, shibboleths&mdash;&ldquo;a
new Halifax&rdquo; for example&mdash;but above all there was a multitude
of models. The extent and scale of the rebuilding
program in one area, the civic-improvement plans which
accompanied the work in that district, the record time in
which relief houses were completed, the marvellous speed
at which the demolition companies cleared away the debris
acted as models and stimuli to all inhabitants. The
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_78" title="78"> </a>
process of speeding-up spread like a great contagion, until the
most hardened pessimist began to marvel at the recuperation
daily enacted before his eyes.</p>

<p>Among the models thus presented may be mentioned that
of the rapid establishment of the morgue. This, the largest
ever organized in Canada, was fitted up by forty soldiers and
mechanics in the brief period of a day and a half. Another
instance was that of the American Hospital. &ldquo;At nine a.&nbsp;m.
Bellevue was an officer's mess. By ten p.&nbsp;m. the same
day it was a first-class sixty-six bed hospital, stocked with
food and medicine and, in charge of Major Giddings;&rdquo; it expressed
a veritable &ldquo;triumph of organizing ability.&rdquo; In the
record time of three months, Messrs. Cavicchi and Pagano,
with a maximum strength of nine hundred and fifty men
and two hundred and seventy horses working ten hours a
day removed every vestige of the debris in the devastated
area. Apartments were built at the rate of one an hour.
Motor lorries multiplied so rapidly that visitors said there
had been an outbreak of &ldquo;truck fever&rdquo; in the place.</p>

<p>By the stimulus of models, such as these, fresh vitality
and motive were imparted to the members of the community.
Halifax became busy as never before. New homes, new
stores, new piers, new banks, replaced the old as if by magic.
Men worked desperately hard.</p>

<p>An influence which must not be left unrecorded because
of its continuity of functioning is that of the stimulus of
lookers-on. More than two hundred cities in all parts of
the world had contributed to the reconstruction, and citizens
of Halifax knew they were not unobserved. Articles, lectures
and sermons were telling forth to interested thousands
how a city blown to pieces, swept by fire, buried under
ice and snow, and deluged by rain, was a city courageous
beyond words. During the month of December, five leading
periodicals in Canada and twelve in the United States
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_79" title="79"> </a>
arranged for articles and photographs descriptive of the
city's advantages commercial and residential.<a name="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Halifax became
a world-known city. This added still further spur
to action. Halifax simply had to make good. She was
bonded to the world.</p>

<p>There are two considerations which may appropriately
bring this chapter to a close. The first arises naturally
from what has been said, namely, that in catastrophe it is
only after division of function delegates to a special group
the responsibility for relief work that public thought is
directed to the resumption of normal society. The second
is a practical deduction&mdash;that of social conservation. Every
community should possess a permanent vigilance committee.
There should be an emergency procedure on paper with
duties outlined to which pledged men may be immediately
drafted. Only in this way can social economy be preserved
until the arrival of experienced disaster authorities
from a distance.</p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_80" title="80"> </a><a name="Chapter_5">CHAPTER V</a><br/>
<small><span class="small-caps">Catastrophe and Social <ins title="Organization (Cont'd)">Economy</ins></span></small></h2>

<p class="hanging-indent">The contribution of social service&mdash;Its four-fold character&mdash;The principles
of relief&mdash;Rehabilitation&mdash;Phases of application&mdash;Criticisms&mdash;A
new principle&mdash;Social results&mdash;Summary for future guidance.</p>

<p><span class="small-caps">We</span> have already seen that there are certain determining
factors in catastrophe and its social results. There is not
only the level of the general capability and culture of the
community, its power to meet crises and to readjust itself,
the scarcity or plenitude of its resources, but also the presence
or absence of &ldquo;men skilled in dealing with crises.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>
In the past, disaster-stricken communities have had such
men or have had them not. The disasters of the future&mdash;with
the exception of those far remote from civilization&mdash;may
depend on the presence of such leaders. They will
come from near and far. The contribution of social service
is the contribution of men skilled in dealing with crises.
Relief thus becomes &ldquo;an incident of progress and a social
policy.&rdquo; We are now to notice this further determining
factor in catastrophe as it applied itself to Halifax.</p>

<p>During the first week at Halifax not only did each day
bring its contribution of relief supplies in the way of food
and clothing, but each day brought also men and women of
skill and experience in social work to place freely their
vision and ability at the service of the community.<a name="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_81" title="81"> </a>The Halifax disaster was one of the first of great extent
which has occurred since the principles of relief have been
authoritatively written. No other community has experienced
their application so fully or so promptly. One
of the workers publicly stated that &ldquo;Halifax was further
ahead in relief work in two weeks than Lynn had been in a
month.&rdquo; It was said that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Never before in any extensive disaster were the essential
principles of disaster relief so quickly established as at Halifax.
In less than twelve hours from the time the American Unit
from Boston arrived, the necessary features of a good working
plan were accepted by the local committee.<a name="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">This was, it is true, sixty hours after the disaster, but nevertheless
the advent of the social specialists brought to Halifax
that something which was wanting when the citizens,
astounded at the magnitude of their task, wondered just
how and where to begin. When Mr. Ratshesky<a name="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> of the
Public Safety Committee of the State of Massachusetts,
came into the room in the City Hall where a dozen or so
were gathered in counsel, already overwrought with fatigue,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_82" title="82"> </a>
it was the coming of a friend in need. It was soon clear
that the new-comers had had unusual experience in dealing
with other disasters. At once everyone took new heart.
Only nine hours later, the Citizens' Relief Committee was
ready, and a working plan adopted; and from it grew up
a wonderful system worthy of study by all students of
emergency relief. Thus social service broke into the midst
of the great calamity not as a mere adjunct to what was
already well devised, but as a central and deciding element,
justifying its faith by its work, and its presence by its
wisdom in grappling with an inexorable need.</p>

<p>Of course there had already been a commendable essay
toward the solution of what had to be done. Applications for
relief came pouring in two hours after the explosion, and
industrious workers had already been dispensing to hundreds.
On Friday morning volunteers were early at the
City Hall, among them many of the public school teachers.
A species of organization had already begun, but under congested
and the least favorable conditions. A large number
of investigators had gone forth, giving information and
relief and bringing back reports of the missing, needy, helpless
and injured. The Salvation Army had commenced a
program of visits to follow up appeals. Clothing of all
kinds was pouring into every station where the refugees
were gathered together. The Canadian Red Cross was
already active. But with the coming of the American Unit,<a name="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
the transfer of the work to a new headquarters upon their
advice, and the adoption of a complete plan of organization,<a name="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
the systematic relief work may be said to have in
reality begun.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_83" title="83"> </a>There was a four-fold contribution made by those experienced
in relief and disaster organization. The initial
service was the establishment of a policy of centralization
of authority and administration into one official relief
organization. This policy comprised first the coördination
of the relief work into one central relief committee, second
the placing of the relief funds from all sources into the
hands of one finance committee, third the granting of relief
by one central management, all records being cleared
through one registration bureau, fourth the giving of emergency
relief in food, clothing and other things immediately
without waiting for the perfection of the relief organization,
and fifth, the appointing of a small managing committee to
carry out and interpret the general policy determined upon
by the executive committee.</p>

<p>If the first great service rendered was that of centralization,
the second was that of effecting coöperation. The
latter was only partially successful. There was at first an
inevitable overlapping, especially in the matter of visiting,
some families being visited and subjected to interview a
dozen times. Failing to achieve complete coördination,
the central committee endeavored to limit duplication so far
as possible. An invitation extended to the Salvation Army
about December eleventh, to place their visitors at the disposal
of the general staff of visitors was declined and it was
not until January first that this organization fully coördinated
with the rehabilitation committee. It was about this time
also that the Roman Catholic clergy agreed to coöperate
in the registration plans. On December eighteenth the
School Board gave official coöperation by assigning fifteen
school teachers as volunteer visitors under the direction of
the rehabilitation committee. Another obstacle to the complete
systematization of the relief work was the most
generous but independent distribution of clothing and supplies
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_84" title="84"> </a>
from the Eaton Center, and from the station established
by a charitable Boston lady. The Protestant and Roman
Catholic clergy, as well as the Salvation Army and other
organizations received supplies in bulk and distributed to
their constituents often with hasty or inadequate investigation.</p>

<p>There was also at times lack of coöperation among the
official committees themselves. Friction and crises arose
from time to time, which were only stopped short of
scandal. They were the consequence either of assumption
of authority upon the part of the under-committees, of ineffectiveness
of leadership, or of unfamiliarity with the
principles of relief. There were also other problems, some
of which it may be useful to note. One of these was the
problem of the wisest use of local leaders who knew and
could interpret the local point of view and method of
doing things. Another that of the absorption of volunteers,
many of whom could not be expected to understand
the nature of scientific relief service.</p>

<p>A third great contribution of social service was that of
education in the principles of disaster relief. It was the
problem of getting the idea of social conservation understood
and established in a community which had not given
the subject any thought, and which was quite unfamiliar
with the ideals and purposes in view. This was the cause
of much delaying of plans, overlapping in giving relief, and
giving without substantial inquiry. It explained also the
reason for the abundant criticism which arose. When
criticism came there was, consequently, no well-informed
body of public opinion to which to anchor the committee's
work.</p>

<p>Educational effort on this subject may be said to have
begun with a masterful presentation of the nature of rehabitation
at the meeting of the managing committee six
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_85" title="85"> </a>
days after the disaster. Here was set forth and illustrated
the kind of service required and the desirability of such
work was at once recognized and inaugurated. Thus the
idea of rehabilitation filtered through to the various departments.
Trained leaders imparted it to the untrained volunteers.
Church, school and club caught something of its
spirit and one of the permanent social results of the disaster
remains in the partial socialization of institutions. It was
this original absence of socialization, this lack of understanding
of the true nature of disaster psychology and of
the accepted methods of relief that at first made the community
so utterly dependent upon the visiting social workers.
It may be safely concluded as a fundamental principle that
the self-dependence of a community in adversity is furthered
by the socialization of existing institutions.</p>

<p>The principles of disaster relief cover three stages, first,
that of the emergency period; second, that of the period of
transition; and third, that of rehabilitation. These principles
in order of application may be thus briefly summarized:</p>

<p>1. The coördination of all the relief agencies arising, into
one central relief service.</p>

<p>2. The directing of relief funds from all sources to one
bonded finance committee.</p>

<p>3. The establishment of a temporary committee only, at
first,&mdash;the more permanent organization to await the counsel
of specialists in disaster relief, an early call having been sent
for experienced workers.</p>

<p>4. The avoidance of, or the early abolition of mass
treatment, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">e.&nbsp;g.</i> bread lines, food depots, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">etc.</i>, as detrimental
to a psychology of helpfulness and as calculated to delay
a return to self-support.</p>

<p>5. The issuing of orders for supplies on local merchants
to follow mass-provisioning.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_86" title="86"> </a>6. The establishment of a policy of renewable cash grants
for short periods until temporary aid is discontinued.</p>

<p>7. Continuance of relief upon a temporary basis until
all claimants are registered and the aggregate of available
aid ascertained, and the needs, resources and potentialities of
self-help studied.</p>

<p>8. An early effort to influence public opinion as to the
wisdom of careful policies and critical supervision.</p>

<p>9. The family to be considered the unit of treatment.<a name="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a></p>

<p>10. A substitution of local workers wherever wise, and
the use of local leaders in responsible positions.</p>

<p>11. The publication of a report, including a critical survey
of policies and methods employed, and a discriminating record
of the social results arising therefrom, the mistakes
made and other information of value for future emergencies.
This report in justice to contributors to include a financial
statement.</p>

<p>The fourth great service rendered was that of the establishment
of rehabilitation policies and methods. The work
of organizing for rehabilitation, as noted above, did not begin
until the sixth day after the disaster. On the eighteenth of
December the first chairman was appointed. There followed
a developmental period during which little progress
was made, save in the familiarizing of committees with the
object of rehabilitation. &ldquo;The object of rehabilitation&rdquo;
says J.&nbsp;Byron Deacon &ldquo;is to assist families to recover from
the dislocation induced by the disaster, and to regain their
accustomed social and economic status. Emergency aid
takes into account only present needs; rehabilitation looks
to future welfare.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> This was the purpose constantly kept
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_87" title="87"> </a>
in view. The division of work indicates the nature of the
task attempted. The division provided for an advisor, a
chief of staff, a supervisor of home visitors, a bureau of
application and registration, an emergency department, a
department of medical social service and a visitor in
children's work. Later a children's sub-committee was included.</p>

<p>There was first the record and registration made and
verified of all the sufferers and those in need. Over six
thousand names of registrants resulted. Five districts or
divisional areas were arranged for convenience and thoroughness
of administration. One of these covered all cases
outside of the city itself.<a name="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> In charge of each district was
a supervisor, and under the supervisor the various department
heads. Trained workers were drawn into the service
and their work and that of the volunteer visitors was
directed by capable supervisors. The administration of relief
was put upon a discriminating &ldquo;case system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were four important phases in which the work
developed; the work of general rehabilitation, the medical
social work, the children's problem and the problem of the
blind.</p>

<p>The general rehabilitation service was carried on with
varied success. It secured valuable intelligence for all committees
and gradually increased in working power and efficiency.
How many were put upon their feet again through
its kindly counsel and careful coöperation cannot be estimated
or told in figures.</p>

<p>The problem of medical social service is to learn the
social condition of the patient, and to relate that knowledge
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_88" title="88"> </a>
to his medical condition in order that restoration to health
and return to normal family and community relationships
shall go hand in hand. A division of medical social service
became active a week after the disaster, its workers becoming
attached to the several emergency hospitals within the
city itself and those established in nearby towns. It had
as well a working relationship with the military and the
permanent Halifax hospitals. Three thousand patients
were cared for in twelve Halifax hospitals alone. Trained
medical social workers interviewed eight hundred. The
one question to which they sought an answer was: &ldquo;How
shall these patients be brought back again as fully as possible
into normal lives and <ins title="relationships.?">relationships?</ins>&rdquo; Having obtained
an answer as best they could, the effort was made to help
and relieve to the fullest extent that service and science
made possible.</p>

<p>The contribution of medical social service was two-fold,
immediate assistance and education. By the latter service,
which represents the more permanent value to the community,
very valuable information and guidance was given
to the Halifax Medical Society and the children's and nursing
interests. The improvements resulting from these efforts
cannot fail to make &ldquo;follow-up&rdquo; and &ldquo;after-care&rdquo;
important considerations in the public health and dispensary
work of the future.</p>

<p>Immediate assistance was given by the medical social
service in six ways:</p>

<ol>
<li>Arranging for clothing and shelter prior to discharge from hospital.</li>
<li>Interviews to understand medical social needs.</li>
<li>Arranging about eye problems with the committee on the blind, children's problems with the children's committee, family problems with the rehabilitation committee, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">etc.</i></li>
<li><a class="pagenum" name="Page_89" title="89"> </a>Making a census of the handicapped, and classifying the returns.</li>
<li>Placing responsibility for follow-up and after-care.</li>
<li>Intensive case work where social problems involved a medical situation.</li>
</ol>

<p class="no-indent">Dr. M.&nbsp;M. Davis, Jr. Director of the Boston Dispensary,
writes of the medical social service as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It may well be concluded that no organization or &ldquo;unit&rdquo;
formed to deal with a flood, fire or explosion or disaster, can
hereafter be regarded as complete unless in addition to doctors,
nurses, relief workers and administrators there is also a due
proportion of trained medical social workers. If twelve years
ago medical social service received its baptism, Halifax has
been its confirmation day.<a name="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The children's service was thorough, as it should have
been. If the measure of success in disaster relief is the
treatment which the children receive, Halifax relief was
above reproach. The children's laws of the province are
carefully drawn and adequate, the Superintendent of
Neglected and Delinquent Children is a man of singular
ability and has wide powers. He became chairman of a
strong children's committee with which were associated,
besides representatives of the children's institutions, two
child-welfare workers of high reputation. This committee
came in contact with upwards of five hundred families,
including more than fifteen hundred children. Their
work dealt with the special problems listed below. More
permanent supervision was assumed by the Government
Commission about five months after the disaster. The
modern principle of the widest possible child-placing was
encouraged, the effort being to keep children with parents
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_90" title="90"> </a>
and wherever necessary to subsidize <ins title="familes">families</ins> rather than institutions.</p>

<p>The work of the children's committee consisted of</p>

<ol>
<li>Getting urgent temporary repairs made to existing children's institutions.</li>
<li>Investigating cases to ascertain if children were in proper custody and receiving proper care.</li>
<li>Procuring necessary articles of clothing, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><ins title="etc">etc.</ins></i>, for children.</li>
<li>Hunting for &ldquo;missing&rdquo; children, identifying &ldquo;unclaimed&rdquo; children, and restoring children to their parents.</li>
<li>Interviewing hundreds of people who were: (a) hunting for lost children; (b) wishing to adopt homeless children; (c) arranging for the care of children.</li>
<li>Attending to a large correspondence, mostly regarding the adoption of children, for which upwards of a thousand applications were received.</li>

<p>The problem of the blind, was a special feature of the
Halifax disaster. Blindness frequently resulted from the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_91" title="91"> </a>
blizzard of glass which caused so great a percentage of the
wounds. In large proportion the wounded were women who
were engaged in their household duties. The rehabilitation
of the blind presented problems of care and retraining upon
which was concentrated the skill of three superintendents of
important institutions for the blind as well as other specialists
and workers. The presence in Halifax of a school for
the blind with a capable president facilitated greatly an
early grappling with the problem. The contributions of
the social workers were chiefly of the character already
indicated such as that of general medical social service.
There were reported on March first, six hundred and thirty-three
registrants,<a name="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> but owing to the difficulties of registration
this figure remains inexact.</p>

<p>Rehabilitation &ldquo;takes into account the feelings as well
as the material requirements of the bereaved families.&rdquo; An
additional phase for social workers is therefore mortuary
service. Here is required an exceedingly delicate ministry
for which few are qualified. It includes quiet coöperation
in the painful process of identification, a sympathetic care
for those who succumb to shock or grief, and helpful direction
regarding the necessary steps to be taken, in interment.
At Halifax this presented a remarkable opportunity for
service, and an experienced Young Women's Christian Association
worker from Toronto attended in such capacity.</p>

<p>There is still another secondary phase which must be referred
to as not being without social and moral results,&mdash;that
of relief of animals. For the sheltering of homeless
animals, the dressing of wounds, and the humane dispatch
of the badly injured, specially designated gifts had been received.
This work received the attention of the Society
for the Prevention of Cruelty.</p>

<p>It will be useful as reference data to present here the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_92" title="92"> </a>
nature of the criticism to which careful supervision gave
rise. It was of the most trenchant character, and it centered
about the alleged over-emphasis which seemed to be
placed on system<a name="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> and detailed investigations inflicted
upon persons of whom many were still suffering from deprivation
and from shock, and who were unused to the
cross-examination methods of expert social diagnosticians.
Often the thoroughness of the records seemed to the sufferers
to be the more emphasized part of the proceedings. When
all classes of people found themselves in need, there were
naturally many who deeply resented being treated so palpably
as &ldquo;cases.&rdquo; But theirs was a choice which left but little
regard for personal wishes or sensibilities. It is regrettable
however to have to say that the cause of social service
did not receive in the community the much larger repute
which its magnificent work justified, chiefly because the innumerable
&ldquo;typewriters, card catalogues, involved indexes,
and multifarious office equipment&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> were not made less
obtrusive. The merest touch of &ldquo;cold professionalism&rdquo;
soon became fuel for the burning disapproval which spread
through the city regarding the methods of relief.<a name="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> Letters
to the press gave vent to the indignation of the sufferers.
One of the judges of the Supreme Court was as outspoken as
anyone. In criticizing the food-distribution system he
wrote very plainly of the &ldquo;overdose of business efficiency
and social service pedantry.&rdquo; Why should needy families
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_93" title="93"> </a>
be required, he asked, to go through a personal visit and
reëxamination at the office every week, before receiving a
renewal order for food. Such things were not easily understood
or explained. It became increasingly felt that such
discriminating and tardy administration of provisions was
not the will of the innumerable donors who so spontaneously
forwarded the generous aid. It was not, so the criticism
ran, for the committee to detain and delay the needy recipients
for the mere sake of preventing duplication and for
the sake of the niceties of case records. At a public meeting
in Wards Five and Six, it was charged that &ldquo;too much
red tape had been insisted upon by those in charge of the
relief and in consequence of this and other objectionable
features of management, there had been many cases of hardship
and much unnecessary suffering.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As to the justice of this it has been already indicated that
criticism was inevitable because there existed no well-grounded
body of public opinion to which could be anchored
the wisdom of sound and thorough social methods.
The passing of time has reënforced the rightness of the
course taken, and not a few former critics would now
be ready to condemn the methods used as not having been
radical enough. Still there was an element of justice in
what was said, and social workers of the future when
thrown into a similar situation should curtain their machinery
a little closer, at least until the community can realize the
principles which organization must conserve.</p>

<p>The principle on which rigid procedure is justified is
based upon disaster psychology itself, and is the fruit of a
long series of trials and errors. On the first few days after
disaster the finer sensibilities of human nature appear. Men
and women say &ldquo;others have lost more, we will get on with
a minimum of help.&rdquo; About the fifth day when the poignancy
of the horrors has passed and the dead are buried,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_94" title="94"> </a>
these same people suddenly discover that there are
thousands of dollars available. Then another aspect of
human nature comes into evidence. Every device is utilized
by each to out-distance the other in the scramble. There
has not been a single disaster where this state of mind has
not shown itself. The way to deal with it without complete
records as yet has not been suggested. The only way
a committee can protect itself against disgruntled criticism
is to know what it is doing. This is the justification of
rigid desk procedure. It is a way to detect and to defeat
imposture; though it serves also many other purposes.
It was not, however, all adverse criticism which developed
at Halifax. There were many who were able to see the
beneficent purpose behind the careful service, and as months
passed on the value of this experienced administration came
to be more generally realized. Indeed</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="no-indent">so large a place did the Social Service workers eventually fill
in the community that many reëstablished families begged for
the continuance of the department's supervision even though
its aid was no longer required. No greater testimony to the
value of this rehabilitation work could be given.<a name="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When on January twenty-first the Federal Relief Commission
took charge of the entire system, it may be said that
there was a change not only of hands, but of policy as well.
The large amounts made available by the Imperial and
Dominion governments and by public subscription made it
possible to substitute for rehabilitation the principle of
modified restitution. This change of policy the government
adopted because of the conviction upon the part
of the people that they were suffering from the vicissitudes
of war, and that full restoration was in law and
equity of national obligation. The step is of special social
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_95" title="95"> </a>
significance for Halifax is the first instance where on any
large scale<a name="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> the principle of restitution became the guide,
rather than that of rehabilitation. This principle of indemnity</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="no-indent">implies the reinstatement of the beneficiary as nearly as possible
into the position from which he was hurled by the calamity
which has befallen him. It implies that to the householder shall
be given the use of a house, to the mechanic his tools, to the
family its household furniture. For the community as a whole
it means a speedy restoration of such economical and industrial
activities as have been temporarily suspended, the rebuilding of
bridges, the reopening of streets, the reëstablishment of banks,
business houses, churches, schools. It requires that protection
shall be given the defenseless, food and shelter to the homeless,
suitable guardianship to the orphan and as nearly as possible
normal social and industrial conditions to all.<a name="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">It must be made clear that while in no case was the Halifax
policy denominated restitution, but rather &ldquo;generous relief,&rdquo;
in actual practice a large proportion of claims were verified
and paid on a percentage basis of the loss suffered, rather
than that of ascertained need. The Commission was granted
power to &ldquo;pay in full all personal property and real estate
claims duly established to an amount not exceeding five
thousand <ins title="dollars.">dollars.&rdquo;</ins> And while in case of the larger claims of
churches, schools, business properties and manufacturing
establishments, and the property of the more prosperous
classes, there was a policy of just and adequate relief
declared, the agitation continued and continues that &ldquo;every
dollar of loss shall be paid in full.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of such a policy in disaster relief Deacon writes: &ldquo;It is
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_96" title="96"> </a>
not the policy of disaster relief to employ its funds in restoring
losses and compensating for death or personal
injury.&rdquo; Commenting on this statement John&nbsp;<ins title="R.">F.</ins> Moors
says: &ldquo;It is interesting to note that at Halifax, the latest
scene of serious disaster, such full compensation is intended.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>What were the social results of this policy? This question
is one of no less interest to the community itself than
to the student of sociology. It is perhaps too early for
adequate examination and comparison with the policy
which formerly held sway. While still a vital question
there are observers who have grown dubious, if not of restitution
certainly of the lump-sum method of restoration.<a name="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
They assert that for many it proved simply a lesson in extravagance
and did not safeguard the economic future of
the recipients. Unused to carrying all their worldly goods
in their vest pockets, these same pockets became empty
again with uncommon rapidity. Victrolas, silk shirts and
furbelows multiplied. Merchants' trade grew brisk with
&ldquo;explosion money.&rdquo; There seemed to be a temporary exchange
of positions by the social classes. The following
statement made by one closely associated with social conditions
in Halifax and written over two years after the
disaster, shows only too well the danger involved in the
application of such a principle. After referring to &ldquo;the
spirit of passive criticism directed chiefly against the few
who have borne the burden of restoration&rdquo; the statement
continues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The individuals who after all make up a community have
been blinded to the bigger interests by their own individual material
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_97" title="97"> </a>losses, and the idea of material compensation on a dollar
for dollar basis. As some of us earlier foresaw, the disaster
wrought much moral damage, for which no &ldquo;claims&rdquo; were
even presented, even by those to whom we might look for
special moral teaching in such an experience. In the course
of our work we come daily upon evidences of this condition
lingering in our midst.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Upon the whole disaster-study inclines to the unwisdom
of &ldquo;the disposition to proceed as though the relief committee
were a compensation board or an insurance society, and to
indemnify for loss.&rdquo; But as already said it is early to appraise.
What in ordinary times might be condemned might
conceivably under the abnormal conditions of war be less
morally dangerous. The system may have been at fault
and not the principle.<a name="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Partly for reasons connected with
the war it was desired to conclude the business with dispatch,
and not to set up a banking house or a training school in
thrift. There remains also the final test, the residuum of
relief, the number of those who will remain permanently
upon the charity list of the community. Will it be said of
Halifax as formerly of Johnstown, that &ldquo;probably so large
a sum never passed into a community of equal size with so
little danger to the personal character of the citizens and so
complete an absence of any pauperizing or demoralizing influences?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lessons which come out of this experience at Halifax
may easily be summarized.</p>

<p>1. The socialization of all communities should be promoted
if for no other reason than for protection.</p>

<p>2. More technical methods of coördination are desirable.</p>

<p>3. To display the machinery of organization is unwise.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_98" title="98"> </a>4. The supervision of voluntary services should be in the
hands of one vocationally trained for the purpose.</p>

<p>5. Further consideration is required as to the policy of
restitution and its administration.</p>

<p>6. The wisdom should be considered of establishing a
secret relief distribution service, such as fraternal societies
conduct for those who though in need will not publicly
accept assistance.</p>

<p>7. The necessity of using trained searchers for the dead,
who will note the precise spot where bodies are recovered,
the centralization of all morgue service, the use of metal
tags instead of paper, the sterilization and preservation of
clothing and effects for purposes of identification, and in
addition the development of a morgue social service with
training and qualifications of a special character.</p>

<p>8. The complete organization of a social relief reserve
with members beforehand definitely assigned to special
tasks, with requisite printed supplies in readiness would
render the most effective social economy in emergency.
This reserve should be trained in the general organization of
shelter, food and clothing, in the shaping of a policy of
general rehabilitation, in medical social service, in children's
work and in the use of volunteers.</p>

<p>To answer the requirements of what could be called in
any sense a sociological treatment of the disaster, the
foregoing chapter on the contribution of social service
could with difficulty be omitted. Social service introduces
a relatively new element of leadership and control upon
which disaster sufferers of the future may rely and which
assures to any community the presence of those who have
special skill in dealing with crises. The &ldquo;relation of the
great man to the crisis is indeed one of the most important
points in the problem of progress&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> in catastrophe. The
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_99" title="99"> </a>
subject also assumes special importance in the development
of the thesis itself. No accounting for social changes
which may hereafter be enumerated can be accurately undertaken
without full consideration of the major influences
which were present. Thus by elimination we may be able
to better gauge the strength of the factor of catastrophe
itself. The place of government and other social factors,
however, has yet to be discussed.<a name="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<h2><a class="pagenum" name="Page_100" title="100"> </a><a name="Chapter_6">CHAPTER VI</a><br/>
<small><span class="small-caps">Catastrophe and Social Legislation</span></small></h2>

<p class="hanging-indent">Governmental agencies in catastrophe&mdash;What seems to be expected of
governments&mdash;What they actually do&mdash;Social legislation&mdash;A permanent
contribution.</p>

<p><span class="small-caps">We</span> have thus far been tracing certain of the major <ins title="influence">influences</ins>
which are brought to bear upon a community when,
after having been overtaken by catastrophe, it is settling
back into its former habitistic channels,&mdash;channels which
not even catastrophe can altogether efface. Some of these
influences are intra-communal and self-generating, such
as the reconstructive impulses already examined. Others
are ultra-communal, such as those vigorous social forces
which sweep in upon a disaster city with the suddenness of
catastrophe itself.</p>

<p>There is a further influence which is of a community yet
in a sense not of it alone, but of all communities&mdash;government&mdash;that
institution of society which expresses its will by
legislation, a will which may or may not be the will of the
community concerned. And because legislative action is
responsible action, and precedent-setting action, it is apt to
be deliberative action. Perhaps this is especially true of
the new and less familiar field of social legislation. While
it may be that the latest group to function effectively at
Halifax was government, social legislation when forthcoming
contributed an important and deciding influence,
and was in turn itself enriched by the calamity.</p>

<p>The boundaries of social legislation are still in the making
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_101" title="101"> </a>
and daily enclosing a wider and wider field. But not
all governments are sympathetic with this process. There
are two standards of legislation&mdash;the one conserves above
all things the rights and privileges of the individual, the
other considers first the community as a whole. The
superiority of the new ideals of legislation rests here, that
it is the general interest which is primarily consulted and
becomes the norm, rather than the rights of the individual
citizen. Progress in legislation includes its extension into
all the affairs of life, retaining as much as may be the liberty
of the individual while progressively establishing the interests
of all.<a name="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Its evolution is traceable from the first poor
laws, all down the long succeeding line of those dealing with
education, health, labor and recreation. However much
agreement or disagreement there may be and is as to the
wisdom of this mutable sphere of ameliorative legislation,
changing just as one ideal or the other happens to be in the
ascendancy, there is at least no doubt as to the duty of the
government to protect and safeguard its citizens.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The one duty of the state, that all citizens, except the
philosophical anarchists, admit, is the obligation to safeguard
the commonwealth by repelling invasion and keeping the
domestic peace. To discharge this duty it is necessary to
maintain a police force and a militia, and a naval establishment.
Such dissent from this proposition as we hear now and then
is negligible for practical purposes.<a name="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">In this duty all governments alike share, be they imperial,
<ins title="federal.">federal,</ins> provincial or municipal, according to their respective
powers.</p>

<p>At Halifax authoritative control following the disaster
was not wholly municipal or wholly martial, but rather an
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_102" title="102"> </a>
admixture of authorities. Policeman and soldier joined
hands as agents of general protection. This service government
did and did at once.</p>

<p>One of the activities of the disaster relief first taken<a name="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> was
that by the Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of Nova
Scotia, when he sent to the Chief of Police of Halifax the
following order:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are hereby authorized to commandeer and make use of
any vehicle of any kind that you find necessary for the purpose
of removing the injured and the dead of this city.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The service of the police of Halifax was highly commendable.
They worked for long periods with little rest
to maintain public peace and order. The splendid service
of the King's soldiers and sailors has already been considered.
They were first and foremost in the work of
rescue and of warning. Military orders to vacate the North
End district as a precautionary measure followed hard upon
the explosion. Military orders permitted the people to
return. Within a few hours after the disaster the military
established a cordon around the devastated district which
no one was allowed to pass without an order, which citizens
having business obtained at the City Hall. This was to
prevent looting as well as to facilitate the search for the
wounded pinned under the debris, and to permit the removal
of the bodies of the killed. The burned and devastated
area was policed by the military for about two months with
the concurrence of civic authority.</p>

<p>But catastrophe calls for much more than protection. It
calls for a procedure, a guidance, a paternal care, and it
calls for it at once. If we ask whether it be the function of
government to take the foremost step of leadership in this
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_103" title="103"> </a>
care, the question is one for Political Science. If we ask
the more sociological question whether governments actually
and always do so, the answer is unhesitatingly&mdash;they do not.
Says Cooley: &ldquo;Like other phases of organization, government
is merely one way of doing things, fitted by its character
for doing some things, and unfitted for doing others.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
This proved one of the things for which it was unfitted.
Not one of the governmental authorities, civic, provincial,
or federal, at once assumed and held authoritatively
and continuously the relief leadership. Indeed it is a
peculiar commentary that they were scarcely thought of as
likely immediately to do so. It should be said, however,
that the Deputy-mayor&mdash;the Mayor being absent from the
city&mdash;was very active personally. While one of the controllers
was himself replacing the dead fire-chief, the Deputy-mayor
called an emergency meeting of citizens on the
morning of the disaster, and another at three in the afternoon
to consider what to do. This meeting of citizens was
presided over by the Lieutenant-Governor, and at it, as already
noticed, a beginning in relief organization was made.
The committees, it will be remembered, were afterwards
reformed upon a new basis on the advice of the American
unit. But no civic resources were pledged to the people
as was done at the Chicago fire. No moneys were then or
subsequently appropriated. The Board of Health did not
assert or assume the leadership in the unprecedented situation.
The City Hall was indeed set up as the relief center
temporarily, but the advice to remove it elsewhere was not
successfully opposed. How little civic authority was retained
under the disaster circumstances is evidenced by the
following complaint. The Board of Control which was
then the legal representative body of the city had no member
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_104" title="104"> </a>
on the executive committee of the disaster administration.
One of these controllers publicly criticised the method of
the Citizens' Committee as autocratic. He &ldquo;almost had to
have a page to reach the Committee as representative of the
Board of Control.&rdquo; When the cabinet ministers from
Ottawa were sitting in session in the legislative council
room, and giving a hearing to a representative public gathering,
the Mayor entered a complaint that the City Council
and Corporation had been ignored by the acting committees.
The <ins title="Citizen's">Citizens'</ins> Committee exercised the general control.
They were entrusted with the special grants and the civic
authorities, Board of Health, police, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">etc.</i>, so far as emergency
matters went, coöperated with them. But the various
civic officers were not idle. No one was idle at Halifax.
They were occupied with the rehabilitation of the various
departments at City Hall and with individual programs
of relief. What the civic government continued to do
officially was rather in the way of providing the stiff
formality of proclamation to the carefully weighed suggestions
of the Citizens' Committee. Several of these proclamations
were issued. Among them was one urging all
people excepting those on relief work or upon especially
urgent business to stay away from Halifax for two weeks.
Another proclamation was a warning to merchants with regard
to demanding exorbitant prices. Over the Mayor's
signature went out the nation-wide appeal for aid that &ldquo;a
sorely afflicted people should be provided with clothing and
food.&rdquo; The subsequent time, thought and help which City
Hall contributed is of less sociological importance to this
study. It is sufficient if we have faithfully described <ins title="muncipal">municipal</ins>
aid in disaster as falling under the general category
of service, rather than direction.<a name="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_105" title="105"> </a>Turning briefly to the provincial and federal spheres of
activity in disaster we note that no special session of the
provincial legislature was called, as was done by the Governor
of Illinois after the calamity which overtook Chicago in
1871. Yet when the legislature of Nova Scotia convened
a fully considered and detailed act was passed incorporating
the Halifax Relief Commission, and designating and defining
its powers.<a name="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> The several articles defined its establishment
as a rehabilitation and reconstruction committee, a
town-planning board, as well as its powers of expropriation,
its relationship to the city charter, certain parts of which
it could amend or repeal; its powers to enforce attendance
at its courts and boards; its relationship to the Workmen's
Compensation Act and to the insurance problem. Besides,
the Commission was also invested with full and adequate
discretion regarding schools, churches and business properties.</p>

<p>Some of the disaster legislative powers and procedures
are of special interest to social legislation. Among these
were the power to repair, rebuild or restore buildings, the
power to repair and carry out a town-planning scheme, the
power to amend, repeal, alter or add to provisions in the city
charter, the automatic assumption of rights of owner to
insure to the extent of the amount expended in repair, and
the automatic cancellation of workmen's compensation
claims. The act incorporating the commission with powers
to make investigation, and administer all funds and properties
constitutes Chapter&nbsp;VI of the year 1918. The
local legislature also passed Chapter&nbsp;XVIII authorizing the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_106" title="106"> </a>
provincial loan of one hundred thousand dollars for the
benefit of the sufferers; and Chapter&nbsp;XIX authorizing cities,
towns and municipalities to contribute for the relief of
sufferers.</p>

<p>The action of Premier Borden of Canada for promptitude
and wisdom is comparable to that of President Harrison
of the United States at the time of the Johnstown flood.
The Canadian Premier at the time of the disaster was in
Prince Edward Island, an island province lying near Nova
Scotia. He at once left for Halifax and arrived the following
day. He immediately placed resources from the
Federal government at the disposal of the local authorities
to assist them in coping with the situation. The third day
after the disaster he attended an important meeting regarding
the harbor, and strengthened greatly the morale of the
city by assuring a complete and rapid restoration of the
harbor. Following the Premier came the Minister of Public
Works and he too gave much administrative assistance.
Then came five members of the Federal Cabinet, each announcing
such programs of restoration as to give the community
new heart and inspiration. Among these announcements
was that of the establishment of a large ship-building
plant upon the explosion area. The Canadian government
had already as its first act made a grant of one million
dollars, toward the sufferers' relief. It was then forcibly
urged upon the government that it assume a responsibility
towards Halifax such as the British government accepts in
&ldquo;its policy of holding itself responsible for loss and damage
by air-raids and explosions.&rdquo; Public opinion seemed to
demand that the work of restoration and reparation be undertaken
by the government of Canada as a national enterprise.
The government while disclaiming all legal liability,
acceded to the request. On January twenty-first there was
announced the formation of a Federal Halifax Relief Commission
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_107" title="107"> </a>
to take over the whole work of rehabilitation and
reconstruction,&mdash;an announcement which brought a feeling
of relief to the already discouraged workers.</p>

<p>Another interesting contrast may be noted in the fact that
while the Governor of Ohio appointed the Ohio Flood Commission
to receive and administer relief funds and supplies,
the Halifax Relief Commission was appointed by the
Governor-General of Canada in Council. This was done
under the &ldquo;Enquiries Act of Canada, being Chapter&nbsp;CIV
of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1906, and under the
War Measures Act, 1914, being Chapter&nbsp;II of the Acts of
Canada for the year 1914.&rdquo; The Federal grant was later
increased to five million dollars, and subsequently to
eighteen millions.</p>

<p>There should also be here recorded the timely succour
afforded by the Imperial Government at Westminster. Following
the King's gracious cable of sympathy, the sum of
five million dollars was voted by the British Government to
the relief of Halifax. The King's words were:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Most deeply regret to hear of serious explosion at Halifax
resulting in great loss of life and property. Please convey to
the people of Halifax, where I have spent so many happy

<p>Reference has already been made to the policy to which
the Commission was committed. This policy may be
more exactly stated by an extract from the act incorporating
the commission:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Whereas</em>, the said Halifax Relief Commission as heretofore
constituted has recommended to the Governor-General
of Canada in Council, that reasonable compensation or allowance
should be made to persons injured in or by reason of
the said disaster and the dependents of persons killed or injured
in or by reason of the said disaster and the Governor-General
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_108" title="108"> </a>of Canada in Council has been pleased to adopt said
recommendation; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">etc.</i></p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the provision of material assistance, the strengthening
of morale and the eventual establishment of a Relief Commission,
government may be said to have contributed an
important and deciding influence in the reorganization of
the community of Halifax and its restoration to normal
conditions.</p>

<p>Not only must social legislation be acknowledged to
have had a very direct determining influence upon whatever
picture of the community is subsequently drawn,
but social legislation itself was enriched by the catastrophe.
The association of catastrophe with progress in social legislation
has already been noticed in our introduction, the mass
of facts in support of which no writer has yet compiled. In
this introduction we noted how on many occasions disasters
have been the preceding reagents in effecting legislation of
permanent social value. It is instanced that city-planning
in America took its rise from the Chicago fire, that the
origin of labor legislation is traceable to a calamitous fever
at Manchester and that the Titanic disaster precipitated
amendment to the Seamen's laws.<a name="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> It has been said that
&ldquo;the vast machinery of the Public Health Department in
England has rapidly grown up in consequence of the cholera
visitations in the middle of the last century;&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> and also
that public health work in America practically began with
yellow fever epidemics. Writing of mining disasters, J.
Byron Deacon says in this connection</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If it can be said that any circumstance attending such disasters
is fortunate, it was that they exercised a profound
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_109" title="109"> </a>influence upon public opinion, to demand new effort and legislation
both for the prevention of industrial accidents and for
the more equitable distribution of the burden of individual
loss and community relief which they involved.<a name="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">Again E.&nbsp;A. Ross writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A permanent extension to the administration of the state
has often dated from a calamity,&mdash;a pestilence, a famine, a
murrain, a flood or a tempest&mdash;which, paralyzing private
efforts has caused application for state aid.<a name="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The student of social legislation who reads this book will
turn first to this chapter, and ask what permanent legislation
will the future associate with so dire a calamity as that
suffered at Halifax. It may be said that not only has
special disaster legislation of precedent-setting value been
enacted serving in a measure to standardize relief legislative
procedure, but social legislation of wider application and
more general character ensued. And this was along the
line which the student of social law should be led to expect.</p>

<p>As calamitous epidemics bring forth regulations of sanitation;
as marine disasters foster regulations ensuring greater
safety at sea, it might well be expected that a great explosion
would bring about regulations controlling the handling
of explosives. And this is in reality what has occurred.
There were approved on the twenty-fifth day of
June, 1919, by the Parliament of Canada, regulations respecting
the loading and handling of explosives in harbors,
applicable to all public harbors in Canada, to which the provisions
of Part&nbsp;XII of the Canada Shipping Act apply; and
to all other public harbors insofar as the same are not inconsistent
with regulations already or hereafter made applicable.<a name="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
They cover</p>

<ol>
<li><a class="pagenum" name="Page_110" title="110"> </a>The provision of special areas for berth, for explosives-carriers.</li>
<li>Regulations of ship control to be observed in the navigation in harbors of explosives-laden vessels.</li>
<li>Regulations to be observed upon vessels carrying explosives.</li>
<li>Regulations governing the handling of explosives.</li>
</ol>

<p class="no-indent">&ldquo;The enactment of these regulations&rdquo; writes the Under-Secretary
of State for Canada<a name="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> &ldquo;was suggested in large
measure by the Halifax disaster.&rdquo; Had these regulations
been in effect and observed in Halifax Harbor it is hardly
conceivable that the great disaster of 1917 could have occurred.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that the recommendation for
this general legislation of social utility originated with the
Drysdale commission&mdash;a board of enquiry appointed by the
Federal Government to determine the cause of the disaster
and whose judgment, was issued on February fourth, 1918.
In Section&nbsp;XIII of this judgment, the following occurs:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="no-indent">that the regulations governing the traffic in Halifax harbor
in force since the war were prepared by competent naval
authorities; that such traffic regulations do not specifically deal
with the handling of ships laden with explosives, and we recommend
that such competent authority forthwith take up and
make specific regulations dealing with such subject.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We, therefore, conclude that the function of government
in disaster is of primary importance, and that social legislation
when forthcoming constitutes an important and deciding
influence and is itself in turn enriched by calamity.
Brought to the test of comparison with observed facts the
statement in the <a href="#Page_13">Introduction</a>, that catastrophe is in close
association with progress in social legislation receives abundant
justification.</p>

<small><span class="small-caps">Catastrophe and Social Surplus</span></small></h2>

<p class="hanging-indent">Mill's explanation of the rapidity with which communities recover
from disaster&mdash;The case of San Francisco&mdash;The case of Halifax&mdash;Social
surplus&mdash;The equipmental factors&mdash;Correlation of tragedy in
catastrophe with generosity of public response&mdash;Catastrophe insurance&mdash;A
practical step.</p>

<p>John Stuart Mill offers a very interesting explanation</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="no-indent">of what has so often created wonder, the great rapidity with
which countries recover from a state of devastation, the disappearance
in a short time of all traces of the mischiefs done
by earthquakes, floods, hurricanes and the ravages of war.<a name="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">This &ldquo;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis medicatrix naturae</i>&rdquo; he explains on an economic
principle. All the wealth destroyed was merely the rapid consumption
of what had been produced previously, and which
would have in due course been consumed anyway. The rapid
repairs of disasters mainly depends, he says, on whether the
community has been depopulated.</p>

<p>But this is not an all-sufficient explanation, and indeed <ins title="aplies">applies</ins>
particularly to countries which have not been bereft of
the raw materials of industrial machinery. San Francisco
recovered exceedingly rapidly from her terrible experience
of 1906. Indeed her quick recovery has been called one
of the wonders of the age. San Francisco was not depopulated.
Her actual losses of life were but four hundred and
ninety-eight, and those injured four hundred and fifteen.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_112" title="112"> </a>
The loss of life on the other hand was about two thousand
in Halifax, a city of fifty thousand population&mdash;but one-eighth
that of San Francisco&mdash;and her list of injured ran
into many thousands. And yet the same phenomenon appeared.</p>

<p>There are other factors both social and economic which
must not be omitted from an account of the influences of
recuperation, namely the equipmental and other factors which
produce social surplus. Disaster-stricken communities cannot
survive unless their &ldquo;surplus energy exceeds their needs.&rdquo;
They cannot become normal until the social surplus is restored.
The social surplus, according to Professor Tenney,
is &ldquo;merely the sum-total of surplus energy existing in the individuals
composing a social group, or immediately available
to such individuals.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> It includes not only &ldquo;bodily vigor&rdquo;
but &ldquo;such material goods also as are immediately available
for the restoration of depleted bodily vigor.&rdquo; It is not only
physiological, as life energy, and social, as conditions of
knowledge and institutional facilities, but also socio-economic,
as equipment for the maintenance or restoration of
physiological and social needs. In catastrophe bodily vigor
may have been depleted, and material goods been consumed.
No period of recuperation or rapid gain can ensue unless such
equipment is in some degree replaced and a balance of social
surplus restored. This is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">conditio sine qua non</i> of recuperation,
and of the transition from a pain-economy to a
pleasure-economy,<a name="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> after disaster. Certainly the maintenance
of the standard of living demands it. The standard of
living has been defined as the &ldquo;mode of activity and scale
of comfort which a person has come to regard as indispensable
to his happiness and to secure and retain which he
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_113" title="113"> </a>
is willing to make any reasonable sacrifice.&rdquo; Following
Professor Seager's association of the standard of living with
population, the reduction of population in catastrophe of a
certain character might conceivably operate to automatically
heighten the standard of living, just as the growth of population
often brings about its fall. But catastrophe often consumes
great quantities of material goods and brings about
a change in incomes and in occupations.<a name="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Seager notes that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Actual starvation confronts more rarely those belonging to
the class of manual workers, but for them also under-nutrition
is a possibility which prolonged illness or inability to
obtain employment may at any time change into a reality. The
narrow margin which their usual earnings provide above the
bare necessaries of life, coupled with their lack of accumulated
savings, makes them especially liable, when some temporary
calamity reduces their incomes, to sink permanently below the
line of self-support and self-respect.<a name="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It must be remembered that at Halifax while the equipmental
damage was stupendous, still the heart of the downtown
business section remained sound. The banking district
held together, and the dislocation of business machinery
was less protracted on that account. To this it is necessary
to add how to a very considerable extent the material
losses were replaced by communities and countries which
not only supplied the city with the material of recuperation
but with men and means as well. Were her own workmen
killed and injured? Glaziers, drivers, repair men and
carpenters came by train-loads bringing their tools, their
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_114" title="114"> </a>
food and their wages with them. The city's population was
increased by thirty-five hundred workmen, twenty-three
hundred of whom were registered with the committee at
one time. Was her glass destroyed? Eighty acres of
transparences came for the temporary repairs and had been
placed by January the twenty-first. Were her buildings
gone? Seven million, five hundred thousand feet of lumber
were soon available to house the homeless. Were her
people destitute? Food and clothing were soon stacked
high. Were her citizens bankrupt because of losses? Fifty
thousand dollars came from Newfoundland, another fifty
thousand from New Zealand, one hundred thousand from
Quebec, one hundred thousand from Montreal, two hundred
and fifty thousand from Australia, five million from Great
Britain. In merchandise, clothing and cash a million came
from Massachusetts. In about fifteen weeks, aside from
the Federal grant, eight millions were contributed. The
total contributions from all sources amounted finally to
twenty-seven million dollars.</p>

<p>Factors such as these must not be omitted in examining
the sociological recuperation of a smitten city. And when
the experience of Halifax is set side by side with the related
experiences of other cities a conclusion may be drawn that
disaster-stricken communities can always count upon public
aid, for the reasons which have already been discussed.
But there is found to be strongly suggested a correlation between
the striking character or magnitude of a disaster and
the generosity of the relief response,<a name="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> as there is also with
the immediacy of the appeal. &ldquo;It is not the facts themselves
which strike the popular imagination&rdquo; says Le Bon, &ldquo;but
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_115" title="115"> </a>
the way in which they take place.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> There have been disasters
relatively serious, such as the St. Quentin forest fire,
where repeated appeals met with astonishingly little response
from the people. &ldquo;A single great accident&rdquo; continues Le
Bon, &ldquo;will profoundly impress them even though the results
be infinitely less disastrous than those of a hundred small
accidents put together.&rdquo; It was in recognition of this principle
that &ldquo;it was decided to transfer the residue of the
amount contributed [after the Triangle fire] to the contingent
fund of the American Red Cross, to be used in disasters,
which in their nature do not evoke so quick or generous
public response, but where the suffering is as grievous.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Besides the relation of the tragic in catastrophe to generosity
and other expressions of sympathy, the experience at
Halifax suggests also a relationship between the aid furnished
by a contributing community and that community's
own previous history in regard to calamity. As an instance
may be cited the quick and splendid response which
came from St. John and Campbellton, two New Brunswick
cities with unforgettable memories of great disasters which
they themselves had suffered. It is also not improbable that
the study of comparative catastrophe would reveal a correlation
between the relative amount of aid given and the
distance of those who give. Indeed there are reasons which
suggest that the relationship might be written thus: that
relief in disaster varies inversely as the square of the cost
distance. The association here suggested is given additional
plausibility from the fact that attention to certain
types of news seems to vary according to this principle,
and news notice is no inconsiderable factor in disaster aid.</p>

<p>Enough has been said to make it clear that at the present
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_116" title="116"> </a>
time, in the absence of any scientific method of socially
ameliorating the consequences of catastrophe, relief is a
fluctuating quantity, and is poorly apportioned from the
point of view of need. While such conditions obtain, disasters
must inevitably contribute to the inequalities which
break the hearts of men. It is alas true, that after all our
generosities and philanthropies</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="no-indent">many people lose their normal position in the social and
economic scale through earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, droughts,
railway wrecks, fires, and the common accidents of industrial
life. These accidents naturally have a vast influence over the
lives of their victims; for they often render people unfit to
struggle along in the rank and file of humanity.<a name="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The only socially defensible way of doing is to spread
the economic results of these disasters over the entire community
in some form of intra-city catastrophe insurance administered
by the Federal government. This alone will
overcome the irrationality of an inequitable levy upon the
more sympathetic, and the fluctuations of disproportionate
relief. And even beyond this step is there not the possibility
of an international system in which each nation will insure
the other? Certainly at Halifax the aid contributed came
from many nations and tongues. But while we are discussing
what ought to be and eventually will be done, one very
practical step remains which may be taken at once. At the
Halifax disaster, we have seen that much of the direction
and technical leadership, welcome <ins title="at">as</ins> it was, and saving the
situation as it did, yet came from without rather than from
within the country. There is no Canadian who will close
these pages without asking whether this must always be.
May it not be respectfully suggested, as a concluding result
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_117" title="117"> </a>
of this study, that the Canadian government, take immediate
steps to develop a staff of experts, a reserve fund,
and stations of relief strategically located in Canada&mdash;these
stations to have in their keeping left-over war-material,
such as tents, stores, and other equipment together with records
of available experts who have had experience in disasters
and who may be subject to call when emergencies
arise.</p>

<p>And now to return to our thesis, and its special enquiry,
namely, wherein is the specific functioning of catastrophe
in social change? We have thus far concerned ourselves
with the major factors of recuperation, intra-social forces,
social service, and legislation.</p>

<p>We find it necessary now to add that the socio-economic
constitutes a no less important factor. But the effects may
not stop with mere recuperation. Suppose a city becomes
in a trice more prosperous and progressive than ever.
Suppose she begins to grow populous with uncommon
rapidity; her bank clearings do not fail but rather increase;
her industries rebuild and grow in numbers; new companies
come looking for sites as if dimly conscious that expansion
is at hand! Suppose a city rises Phoenix-like from the
flames, a new and better city, her people more kind, more
charitable, more compassionate to little children, more considerate
of age! Suppose there come social changes which
alter the conservatism and civic habits of many years&mdash;changes
which foster a spirit of public service, and stimulate
civic pride! Then there is clearly some further influence
associated with the day of disaster. Perhaps we shall find
progress innate in catastrophe itself.</p>

<p class="hanging-indent">The unchanging Halifax of the years&mdash;The causes of social immobility&mdash;The
new birthday&mdash;The indications of change: appearance, expansion
of business, population, political action, city-planning, housing, health,
education, recreation, community spirit&mdash;Carsten's prophecy.</p>

<p><span class="small-caps">Halifax</span> has had her fair proportion of tribute in her
time. Kipling has called her &ldquo;the Warden of the Honor
of the North.&rdquo; Pauline Johnston sings of her pride of
situation. As Edinburgh, &ldquo;it is a city of many charms;
beautiful for situation, beyond most of the cities of the
world; vocal with history beyond most, for at every turn of
its streets some voice from the past &lsquo;comes sounding
through the toon.&rsquo;&rdquo; Her public gardens are the envy of
all. Her vistas of the sea are without compare. Her Northwest
Arm is a veritable joy. Birds sing in her homes.
Cheery wood-fires burn brightly in her open grates. No
city of her size is more hospitable than she.</p>

<p>But she has always been a city which has never quite
entered into her heritage commercially. Situated where
by nature she might well be great, she has always been
small. Unambitious, wealthy<a name="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> and little jealous of the
more rapidly-growing cities, she has prided herself on
being a lover of better things. Commerce and industry
were things alien<a name="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> and secular. She devoted herself to
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_119" title="119"> </a>
standards of art, music, learning, religion and the philanthropies.
Charitable and philanthropic institutions abounded.
She has had her own conservative English ways. She
affected homage to &ldquo;old families,&rdquo; and to that illusory
element &ldquo;social prestige.&rdquo; She welcomed each new knight
which the favor of the king conferred, and grew careless
of civic prosperity and growth. She had leaned &ldquo;too long
upon the army and the navy&rdquo; and her citizens had become
&ldquo;anaemic,&rdquo; &ldquo;lethargic&rdquo; and standstill; their &ldquo;indifference&rdquo;
and &ldquo;inertia&rdquo; were a commonplace. Halifax had been
complacent and academic rather than practical in her outlook
upon the world and her general attitude toward life.</p>

<p>Geographically she suffered by her situation on the
rim of the continent. She experienced not a little neglect
and isolation because she was an undeveloped
terminal, and not a junction point. Travellers and commercial
men could not visit her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> but only by special
trip.</p>

<p>Again &ldquo;the government has had altogether too many interests
in Halifax for the good of the place.&rdquo; &ldquo;Government-kept
towns&rdquo; are not as a rule &ldquo;those which have
achieved the greatest prosperity.&rdquo; Halifax as a civil-service
headquarters and a government military depot was perhaps
open to the charge of being at least &ldquo;self-satisfied.&rdquo;
Valuable acres of non-taxable land have been far from stimulating
to civic enterprise.</p>

<p>An historic city too, Halifax fell under the blight of
overmuch looking backward, and sociologically the back look
has been always recognized as the foe of progress. But
she has had a past to be proud of&mdash;one which throbs with
incident and interest. Born as a military settlement, she
has been a garrison city and naval station for more than a
hundred and fifty years. She has been called &ldquo;the stormy
petrel among the cities&mdash;always to the front in troublous
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_120" title="120"> </a>
times.&rdquo; She has served and suffered in four hard wars.
She has gloried in this wealth of years and storied past.
Her traditions have been traditions of royalty, blue blood,
dashing officers, church parades, parliamentary ceremonies,
fêtes, levées and all the splendor and spirit of old colonial
times. A newspaper has published daily items of a generation
before, and weekly featured a reverie in the past.<a name="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> Old in
her years she remained old in her appearance, old in
her ways, and in her loves. She boasted old firms which
have kept their jubilees, old churches wherein was cradled
the religious life of Canada, an old university with a century
of service. Each noon a cannon boomed the mid-day
hour, and like a curfew sounded in the night.</p>

<p>Search where one will, it would be difficult to find
another city which has more completely exhibited the causes
of social immobility as set forth by sociology. For there
are, it must be remembered, causes of immobility as well
as factors of social change. They may be geographical
difficulties, or elements more distinctively social&mdash;an over-emphasis
of government, discouraging innovation, too great
a &ldquo;volume of suggestion,&rdquo; the drag of &ldquo;collective customs
and beliefs,&rdquo; a &ldquo;traditionalist educational system,&rdquo; the &ldquo;inheritance
of places and functions&rdquo; tending to arrest development,
&ldquo;government, law, religion and ceremony, hallowed
by age.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> All these reënforce the conservative tendencies
in society and preserve the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">status quo</i>.<a name="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_121" title="121"> </a>Diagnosis in detail is not essential here. Up to the time of
the disaster Halifax had certainly preserved the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">status quo</i>.
We need not labor the how and why. Tourists had returned
year after year and found her unaltered. &ldquo;Dear,
dirty old Halifax&rdquo; they had called her. They had found
business as usual,&mdash;old unpainted wooden houses on every
side, unswept chimneys, an antiquated garbage system and
offensive gutters; the best water and the poorest water
system an inspector ever examined; the purest air but the
most dust-laden in a storm; an obsolete tramway,<a name="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> a
&ldquo;green market,&rdquo; ox-carts on the main streets, crossings ankle-deep
with mud, a citizenship given over to late rising. Instead
of making the city they had been &ldquo;letting it happen.&rdquo;
The &ldquo;transient, the good-enough, the cheapest possible&rdquo;
had been the rule of action.</p>

<p>Such has been the unchanging Halifax of the years. But
the old order changeth. The spell of the past is broken.
A change has come over the spirit of her dreams. There are
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_122" title="122"> </a>
signs that a new birthday has come. The twenty-first day
of June was the old Natal Day, kept each year with punctilious
regularity. But Halifax is now just beginning to
realize that there was a new nativity, and that it dates from
December&mdash;that fatal Sixth. &ldquo;Sad as was the day, it
may be the greatest day in the city's history.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Almost instinctively since the disaster Halifax has come to
see the sources of her weakness and of her strength. Her
geographical position which once meant isolation<a name="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> will henceforth
be her best asset. Just as the geographical expansion
of Europe made the outposts of the Old World the entrepôts
of the New, so the expansion of Canada and of Nova
Scotia&mdash;the province with the greatest number of natural
resources of any in the Dominion&mdash;to the newly awakening
city appears full of substantial promise. It will be largely
hers to handle the water-borne commerce of a great country.
Henceforth the ocean will become a link and not a limit.
World-over connections are the certainties of the future,
bound up inevitably with the economic and social solidarity
of nations. Closer to South America than the United
States, closer to South Africa than England, closer to Liverpool
than New York, Halifax sees and accepts her destiny,
forgets the inconvenience and loss she has undergone and
the many annoyances of blasting and of digging, that the
facilities of her &ldquo;triple haven&rdquo; might be multiplied and the
march of progress begin. &ldquo;The new terminals with their impressive
passenger station, will not only be an attractive front
door for Halifax, but will fit her to be one of the great
portals of the Dominion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There has come upon the city a strange impatience of
unbuilt spaces and untaxed areas sacred for decades to
military barracks and parades. She has urged for some
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_123" title="123"> </a>
immediate solution, with the result that military property
will be concentrated and many acres released to the city for
its own disposal.</p>

<p>Whether the pendulum will swing so far as to imperil the
retention of old historic buildings, time-stained walls, and
century-old church-yards is not yet apparent; although suggestions
have been made which would have astounded the
Halifax of a generation ago. Certain it is that a period of
orientation is at hand. There is a stirring in the wards and
clubs for progressive administration and modern policies.
&ldquo;Here as elsewhere the time has now come for clear thinking
and the rearrangement of traditional thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indications of change are already abundant. The first
to note is that of appearance. For illustration may be
quoted an editorial published near the second anniversary of
the explosion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Halifax has been improving in appearance since the explosion,
exhibiting very sudden changes at particular points.
One almost forgets what the city was like about ten years ago.
Still there is a great deal to be done in the way of improvement
to our streets. The move in the direction of permanent streets
is an excellent one and if carried out as designed will be an
improvement and saving to the city.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The report of the Secretary of the Board of Trade makes
the following reference to the change in appearance of the
city:</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="no-indent">One of the pleasing features in reference to both the wholesale
and retail business of Halifax is the improved condition
of premises over a few years ago; retail stores are now having
up-to-date and attractive fronts, while wholesalers are improving
their show-rooms and thereby increasing their sales.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Mayor writes regarding the sidewalk improvement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Some twenty miles of concrete sidewalks to be constructed
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_124" title="124"> </a>are on the order paper to be taken in turn so as to be as uniform
as possible. This will go a long way toward improving
the appearance of the city.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As to the change in the style of houses the Mayor states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A pleasing feature of the new construction is the departure
from the former square box style of dwelling, also
the method of placing rows of houses exactly in the same
style. Today homelike houses of modern design, set back
from the street with lawns in front are the order of the day&mdash;bungalows
are particularly in favor.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fine new residences are being built, apartment ideas are
spreading, new lights are being tried out, a new tram company
has taken hold. Indeed one citizen is credited with the
words: &ldquo;It is almost a sacrilege that Halifax should be so
changed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The consciousness of change is seen in an altered public
opinion and the beginnings of a new civic outlook. Evidence
of the new note is a statement by one of the progressive Halifax
firms:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Halifax is going to make good. Outside firms are taking
up valuable sites in our business districts. The banks are
increasing their activities. Some of the biggest industries are
coming our way. Surely everything points toward prosperity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">Another feature indicative of the changing consciousness,
which has infected a much wider region than Halifax itself
is the plan now making rapid progress for an Old
Home Summer, to be held from June to October, 1924. The
project has already received legislative recognition. An
effort will be made to recall former residents on a scale such
as has never been attempted before. The committee in
charge is made up of many prominent citizens and the
&ldquo;1924 Club&rdquo; grows. One may observe still another indication
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_125" title="125"> </a>
of the determination to progress in the recent completion
of a system linking-up Halifax by telephone with
Montreal, Toronto, New York and Chicago.</p>

<p>Indices of business conditions are far from satisfactory,
yet the items used in their computations are the only ones
upon which variations may be even roughly gauged. Roger
Babson puts as the leading considerations: (1) Building
and real estate; (2) bank clearings; (3) business failures.
Other symptomatic facts are postal revenues, tramway receipts,
exports, taxes, interest rates, insurance, wages and
hours, commodity prices, unfilled orders, immigration and
unemployment.<a name="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>With regard to the first the following statement issued
by the Mayor is significant. He says:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The year 1919 has been one of exceptional prosperity in
the City of Halifax. It has been a record year for building.
Permits to the approximate value of $5,000,000 have been issued
to the engineer's office, the largest amount by far in its
history, the amount being practically ten times that of 1913, or
the year before the Great War commenced. A part of this only
can be attributed to the terrible explosion of 1917.</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">He refers to the great amount of construction going on in
the western and northwestern parts of the city which were
relatively untouched by the disaster. The Mayor further
states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It must be remembered that it is only two years since the
devastation caused by the explosion and strangers in the city
have considered it wonderful that we are so far advanced in
building up that portion which only a year ago had not a
house upon it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The following tabulation gives the building figures according
to the permits issued at the City Hall. It shows a
remarkable recent increase.</p>

<p>With regard to real estate the Mayor writes in December
1919</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The increase in the selling values of properties is remarkable.
Business property has taken a jump in value, and it
is difficult to get for business purposes property well situated
unless at very high prices. Property has been known to change
hands within a year at approximately double the amount
originally paid.</p>
</blockquote>

greatly in excess of what properties were valued at in pre-war
days.</p>

<p>Among other assurances at the new prosperity and the
beginnings of fresh faith in the city's future is the coming
of new large business interests into the city. Among the
largest construction work is the building of the Halifax
shipyards upon the explosion ground, involving an outlay
of ten millions of dollars. There is the ever-extending
plant of the Imperial Oil Company, which will eventually
make of Halifax a great oil-distribution port. There is the
continuation of the thirty-million-dollar scheme of modern
terminal facilities, which have been constructed so close to
the ocean that a ship may be out of sight of land within an
hour after casting off from the quay.</p>

<p>In short there has been, as has been said, an &ldquo;impetus
given to business generally.&rdquo; That the impetus will continue
there is every prospect. Halifax may experience
a temporary wave of depression when such waves are flowing
elsewhere. But today there are fewer doubters and more
believers. The day of new elevators, new hotels, harbor-bridges
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_128" title="128"> </a>
and electric trains is not very far away. The
prophecy of Samuel Cunard made in 1840&mdash;when he inaugurated
the first Trans-Atlantic line&mdash;that &ldquo;Halifax
would be the entering port of Canada&rdquo;&mdash;seems destined to
fulfilment.</p>

<p>As regards population after disasters Hoffman writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Even an earthquake such as affected the city of San
Francisco may not materially change the existing numbers
of the population after a sufficient period of time has elapsed
for a reassembling of the former units, and a return to the
normal conditions of life and growth.<a name="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="no-indent">Yet as before remarked, the catastrophe at Halifax
eclipsed all preceding disasters to single communities on the
Continent of America in the toll of human life.<a name="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> In the
San Francisco earthquake the loss was four hundred and
ninety-eight; at the Chicago fire three hundred; at the Iroquois
theatre fire in the same city, five hundred and seventy-five;
at the Chester explosion one hundred and twelve; at the
Johnstown flood two thousand. It is now estimated that
the disaster at Halifax probably passed this latter figure,
decreasing the city's population by four per cent. Notwithstanding
this heavy draught upon the population, the
1918 volume of the Halifax Directory contained six
hundred and fifty more names than the previous year.</p>

<p>In the light of this consideration the following indication
of the growth of population is also of contributory interest.<a name="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a></p>

<p>Instead of the disaster resulting in disheartenment and
a gradually diminishing civic interest, the percentage of indifference
is smaller and the percentage of interest is larger
for 1920 than for 1919, and the percentage of interest for
1919 is larger than that for the previous year. The number
of eligible voters also shows increase. &ldquo;The campaign [for
1920] has marked a new era .... and will make it easier
to institute new reforms.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>Of further sociological interest is the change affecting
city-planning, civic improvement, housing, health, education
and recreation.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_130" title="130"> </a>In the realm of city-planning<a name="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a> and civic improvement,
Halifax is awaking to the importance of taking advantage
of an opportunity which comes to a city but seldom save
through the avenue of disaster. The present Town-planning
Board was formed as a result of the Town-planning
Act of 1915. A board of four members, including the city
engineer constitute the committee. The limits of the area
to be brought under the scheme were still undecided when
the explosion came. The disaster &ldquo;hastened the resolution&rdquo;
of the Board. &ldquo;When the disaster came it seemed
that things would have to come to a head.&rdquo; Mr. Thomas
Adams, the Dominion Housing and Town-planning Advisor,
was brought to Halifax to help determine what should
be done. &ldquo;The disaster simply had the effect of bringing
to a point certain things which were pending at the time.
If that event had not occurred we would by this time be
into a scheme, though possibly not so far as we are.&rdquo; Today
the limits of the area have been defined and the scheme
is nearly ready for presentation to the Council for adoption.
The Dominion Town-planning Advisor's assistant reports
that real progress has been made in the Halifax plan dealing
with the proposed zoning of the city into factory, shopping
and residential districts, the provision for future streets,
street-widening and building lines, and suggestions for park
and aerodrome sites. In the devastated area he has remarked
progress in street-opening, in grading of the slope
and in architectural treatment of the houses. Five hundred
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_131" title="131"> </a>
trees and three hundred shrubs have been ordered to be
planted in this area. The whole area is under the control of
the Relief Commission, for the Act appointing the Commission
gave it the powers of a Town-planning Board.</p>

<p>The disaster may thus be said not only to have hastened
the resolution of the existing committee, but to have produced
two planning-boards instead of one. Each must
keep in mind the true ideal. For it is not the &ldquo;City
Beautiful&rdquo; idea, but that of utility that is fundamental to
city-planning. It is a principle to reduce to the minimum
the social problems of community life, to accomplish
Aristotle's ideal&mdash;&ldquo;the welfare and happiness of everyone.&rdquo;
In so doing civic beauty will not be neglected. &ldquo;Scientific,
sensible and sane city-planning&rdquo; says an authority &ldquo;with
utility and public convenience as its primary consideration
produces beauty&mdash;the beauty that is the result of adapting
successfully a thing to its purpose.&rdquo; It is in accordance
with this principle of civic art that the terminal area is
being developed&mdash;a work designed by the same architect
who planned the Chateau Laurier and the Ottawa Plaza with
such aesthetic taste.</p>

<p>To &ldquo;deep cuttings, spanned by fine bridges, and bordered
with trees and pleasant driveways, after the manner of
Paris,&rdquo; and to a &ldquo;waterfront as stately as Genoa's, a terminal
station with a noble facade, overlooking a square
and space of flowers,&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> the future will also bring to Halifax</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="no-indent">more street-paving, sidewalks, parks, fountains, hedges, driveways,
cluster-lighting, statuary, buildings of majesty, spaciousness
and beauty. Wires will be buried, unsightly poles will
disappear.... With time will come all these things which
stamp a city as modern, as caring for the comfort of its
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_132" title="132"> </a>people, their pleasure and rest, and health and safety. All
these things come with time, effort, development of city pride,
and the concentrated desire of a people for them.<a name="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The question of housing is recognized as an old Halifax
problem. It was already an acute one when the blow of
the catastrophe fell and multiplied the difficulty a thousand-fold.
The Relief Commission has grappled with its
end of the problem, namely, the housing of the many refugees
who were first accommodated in lodgings and in
temporary shelters.<a name="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> The old sombre frame-constructed
buildings of the pre-disaster days are being replaced with
attractive hydrostone. A hard-working wage-earning community
is stepping out of indifferent structures into homes
both comfortable and well-ordained.</p>

<p>But the old problem would have still remained unsolved,
had not the city authorities caught something of the reconstruction
spirit and felt the sharp urge of increasing
difficulties. Action has been at last precipitated. However,
lacking in comprehensiveness the first attempts, the
city has bestirred itself and has come to realize adequate
housing to be a supreme need of the community and vitally
associated with the city's health and welfare. A Housing
Committee of five members has been formed, having as
chairman a man of widely recognized building experience and
as director of housing, a capable citizen. It is intended to
make full use of the federal housing scheme, in a practical
way, the City Council having reversed its former decisions
and accepted by by-law the obligation which the government
act requires. It is hoped in this way to promote the
erection of modern dwellings and to &ldquo;contribute to the
general health and well-being of the community.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_133" title="133"> </a>Thus the principle of promotive legislation and government
aid, which when finally accepted in 1890, began the
remarkable housing reform in England, has entered the
City of Halifax, and will eventually write a record of increased
health, comfort and contentment. How soon that
record is written will largely depend upon the citizens themselves
and their response to a leadership that is forceful as
well as wise.</p>

<p>The matter of health organization in Halifax affords
perhaps the most significant contrast with the pre-disaster
days. Prior to the catastrophe public health organization
was not a matter for civic pride. The dispensary, which
is often regarded as the index of a city's care for health,
had received scant support and could only perform indifferent
service. Adequate sanitary inspection could not
be carried out for want of inspectors. The death rate<a name="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> had
averaged about twenty percent for a period of ten years,
and the infant and tuberculosis mortality had been tremendously
high&mdash;the former reaching the figure of one hundred
and eighty-two.<a name="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> There was no spur to progressive administration.
The city was too ill-equipped to cope with
such conditions.</p>

<p>Today Halifax has the finest public health program and
most complete public health organization in the Dominion.
The fact that this is so is in very close relation to the
catastrophe inasmuch as an unexpended balance of relief
moneys<a name="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> has been redirected by request for health purposes
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_134" title="134"> </a>
in Halifax. A five-year policy has been inaugurated. Fifty
thousand dollars per year of the relief money, fifteen thousand
dollars per year of the Canadian government money and
five thousand dollars per year each, of the city and provincial
money are to be expended in the five-year campaign.
The sum totals seventy-five thousand dollars per year, or
practically one dollar per capita.</p>

<p>A completely equipped health centre has been established
including all the essential remedial and educational agencies,
namely, pre-natal, pre-school-age, school-age, tuberculosis,
venereal disease, eye, ear, nose and throat clinics. There
will also be provision for the growth of health ideas through
mother's classes, first-aid, and sanitary leagues. A public
health course for nurses is included in the educational campaign.<a name="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>
A most successful baby-saving exhibit has been
held, and the plan calls for a full-time tuberculosis specialist.</p>

<p>Upon the part of the civic authorities there has been a
greater realization of responsibility. Progressive steps
have been already taken including the appointment
of a Doctor of Public Health, and the provision of
district sanitary inspectors. Restaurants and all places
where food is exposed for sale are being systematically inspected
with a view of effecting improvements. A single
instance of commendable activity along sanitary lines is the
prohibition of movable lunch cars, which have been seen
on the streets of Halifax for years. The removal of a lot
of dwellings unfit for occupation is receiving the attention
of the officials. In fact it is the intention of the present
Council to improve conditions throughout the city generally
as quickly as is feasible to do so. Another illustration of the
direction of attention to modern social methods is the present
discussion of plans for a psychiatric clinic for mental
hygiene and the discovery of defectives, especially those
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_135" title="135"> </a>
attending the schools. Still another indication of interest
in child welfare is the fact that a clinic for babies was established
in a central locality and a nurse for babies regularly
employed. The hitherto meager hospital facilities are being
amplified by the building of a maternity hospital and the enlargement
of the children's hospital,&mdash;a centralization plan
of hospital service being a unique and distinctive feature. In
the way of industrial hygiene a full-time nurse is employed in
the ship-building plant and here also safety policies have been
introduced and have reduced accidents to a minimum. The
movement for the control of preventable disease is gaining
impetus and a modern tuberculosis hospital is being established.
The Victoria General Hospital is being enlarged
and extended, the additions having an estimated cost of
half a million dollars.</p>

<p>But it is not alone the activities of the Health Commission
but also the earlier vigorous policy of disaster
medical relief, which is seen reflected in the growing sense
of community-responsibility for health conditions. Halifax
has come to see the principle fundamental to all health
reform, that public health is a purchasable commodity and
that improvement in vital statistics is in close correlation
with the progress of health organization. It remains to
be seen whether so favored a community will also lead the
way in the registration and periodic health examination of
every individual citizen which is the final goal of all policies
of health reform.</p>

<p>The standards of education have always been high in
Halifax. She has been the educational center of the
Maritime Provinces. Her academic attainments have
brought to her much distinction and not a little glory. Her
public schools boast many a fine record to furnish inspiration
to each successive generation. To secure appointment to
the Halifax teaching staff the applicant must possess the
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_136" title="136"> </a>
highest qualifications. But however much educational leaders
may desire them, modern methods and up-to-date equipment
await in large measure the public will. Only where
there is a will is there a way. That the public will in Halifax
is becoming awakened to the vital rôle her educators
play is being proven by the response to the campaign for the
expansion of Dalhousie University. That response has been
most generous and general, while local contributions have
been amplified by large benefactions from the Carnegie
Corporation and the Rockefeller Foundation. Of the latter
benefactions together amounting to one million dollars&mdash;four
hundred thousand will be expended upon buildings and
equipment. The modernizing process is shown again in
the decision of the university to establish at once a Faculty
of Commerce and to encourage the teaching of Spanish and
Portuguese in the educational institutions of the city.</p>

<p>In the old teaching methods all are given the same course
of instruction regardless of the individual mental differences.
Today the effort is to provide an education to fit the mind
rather than to force the mind to fit the education. In the
public schools of Halifax there are not lacking indications
which herald the coming of the newer pedagogy. Among
these may be mentioned the opening of sub-normal classes
for retarded children, experimentation with the social-recitation
system, the display of Safety-First League posters
and the development of those departments already established,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viz.</i> vocational and domestic training, manual and
physical education, medical inspection, supervised playgrounds,
school nurses, dental clinics, and the wider use
of school plants in evening technical classes.</p>

<p>Halifax will sooner or later decide to employ to the fullest
degree all the opportunities which child-training affords.
The school system is an institution of society to
mediate between a child and his environment. Children
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_137" title="137"> </a>
must learn to do and to be as well as to know. Their
plastic minds must receive practice in resistance to domination
by feeling and in the use of the intellect as the servant
and guide of life. To the children of Halifax is due
eventually a thorough training in citizenship. This is the
last call of the new future in education. It rests upon the
twin pillars of educational psychology and educational
sociology.</p>

<p>Recreation is still another sphere of civic life wherein
the City of Halifax has taken a forward step. In making
her plans for the future she has not forgotten that the rebuilt
city should contain every facility for children to grow
up with strong bodies and sane minds; as well as public provision
for the leisure time of the adult population. A Recreation
Commission has been formed made up of representatives
of the various civic bodies and from the civic and provincial
governments.<a name="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> A playground expert was called in
by the city government, who after study of the situation and
conference with local groups, recommended a system of
recreation as part of the general city plan. Already marked
progress has resulted; indeed it has been said that the
&ldquo;municipal recreation system of Halifax has made a record
for itself.&rdquo; A hill of about fifteen acres in the heart
of the devastated area has been reserved for a park and playground.
The city has built and turned over to the Commission
a temporary bath-house, and has set aside the sum of
ten thousand dollars for a permanent structure. The plans
contain recommendations for minimum play-space for every
school child, a central public recreation area, an open-air
hillside stadium, as well as a community center with auditorium,
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_138" title="138"> </a>
community theatre, natatorium, gymnasium, and
public baths. The real significance of this movement Halifax
has not, herself, as yet fully realized. Just as there is
a close relationship between health organization and mortality
tables, so there is a close association between open
spaces, street play, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">etc.</i>, and juvenile, as well as other forms
of delinquency.<a name="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> The moral value of organized recreation
was itself demonstrated in the war, while the increasing
menace of industrial fatigue, as well as the fact of the shorter
working-day, call for public recreational facilities as a
social policy. This policy is not however fully carried out
with merely constructive and promotive action. It must be
followed by restrictive and regulatory control of commercialized
recreation, and wise and adequate systems of inspection
for amusement in all its forms. This is the path of progress
in socialized recreation.</p>

<p>Progress in coöperation has also to be noticed. There
has been a new sense of unity in dealing with common problems.
The number of things which perforce had to be
done together during the catastrophe was great. This doing
of things together will be continued. The establishment of
the Halifax Coöperative Society is initial evidence of a
movement towards coöperative buying. Coöperation for
community ends even now is revealing itself in the new
interest for the common control of recreation, health conditions,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">etc.</i> &ldquo;The disaster,&rdquo; runs an article in the press,
&ldquo;has given our social movement an impetus. The social
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_139" title="139"> </a>
workers of the different creeds and classes have discovered
each other and are getting together.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> The organization of
social service which only a few years back took a beginning
in the form of an unpretentious bureau has shot ahead with
amazing rapidity and now exercises an influence of coördination
upon the churches, charities and philanthropic societies
of the city.</p>

<p>The unifying process is well illustrated by the increased
coöperation upon the part of the churches. Following the
disaster the churches of the city united into a single organization
for relief service under the chairmanship of the
Archbishop of Nova Scotia. Since then a Ministerial Association
has been formed which has directed coöperative
effort along various lines and has exercised pressure upon
those in authority where the best interests of the city were
involved.</p>

<p>Thus the City of Halifax has been galvanized into life
through the testing experience of a great catastrophe. She
has undergone a civic transformation, such as could hardly
otherwise have happened in fifty years. She has caught
the spirit of the social age. This spirit after all means only
that the community is just a family on a larger scale, and
the interests of each member are interwoven with those of
all. But merely to catch the spirit will not suffice. It
must be cherished through an inevitable period of reaction
and passivity, and then carried on still further into the relations
of capital and labor, into the realm of socialized recreation
and into those multiform spheres of social insurance
whither all true social policies lead.</p>

<p>All these converging lines taken not singly but together
constitute a very real basis of faith in the city's future, and
of hope for permanent changes for the better. Perhaps
this attitude cannot be more fittingly expressed than in the
words of Carstens:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a class="pagenum" name="Page_140" title="140"> </a>The Halifax disaster will leave a permanent mark upon
the city for at least a generation, because so many of the living
have been blinded or maimed for life. But it is possible that
the disaster may leave a mark of another sort, for it is confidently
believed by those who took part in the relief work
during the first few weeks that Halifax will gain as well as
lose. The sturdy qualities of its citizens will bring &lsquo;beauty
out of ashes.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it is rather for social than for material progress that
the sociologist will seek and Carstens continues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It may reasonably be expected that through this Calvary,
there may be developed a program for the care, training and
education of the sightless as good if not better than any now
existing, that medical social service will be permanently grafted
upon the hospital and out-patient service of the community,
and that the staff of teachers of the stricken city, by direct contact
with the intimate problems of the families of the children
they have in their class-rooms may acquire a broader view
of their work. If there should result no other benefits, and
there are likely to be many, as for example city-planning,
housing and health, the death and suffering at Halifax will
not have been in vain, will not have been all loss.<a name="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<small><span class="small-caps">Conclusion</span></small></h2>

<p class="hanging-indent">Recapitulation&mdash;The various steps in the study presented in propositional
form&mdash;The rôle of catastrophe direct and indirect. (a) Directly prepares
the ground-work for change by: (1) weakening social immobility;
(2) producing fluidity of custom; (3) enhancing environal
favorability for change&mdash;(b) Indirectly sets in motion factors determining
the nature of the change such as: (1) the release of spirit and
morale; (2) the play of imitation; (3) the stimulus of leaders and
lookers-on; (4) the socialization of institutions.</p>

<p><span class="small-caps">If</span> the preceding narrative has been successful in setting
forth the facts as they were observed, the reader has now
before him a fairly accurate picture of a community as it
reacts under the stimulus of catastrophe and proceeds to
adjust itself to the circumstantial pressure of new conditions.
It will be well, however, for the sake of clearness
in emphasizing our closing propositions to recapitulate one
by one the various steps in our study. These steps while
primarily intended to follow the natural order in point of
time will also be seen to represent a definite sociological process
of development.</p>

<p>At first the shock of the catastrophe was seen to have been
sufficiently terrific to affect every inhabitant of the city.
This fact gives peculiar value to the investigation. The
more a shock is limited in extent the more its analysis grows
in complexity. In such cases consideration must necessarily
be given to the frontiers of influence. The <a href="#Chapter_1">chapter <ins title="discribing">describing</ins>
the shock</a> also found the immediate reaction to have been
a fairly general disintegration of social institutions, and of
the usual methods of social control&mdash;in short, a dissolution
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_142" title="142"> </a>
of the customary. This turmoil into which society was
thrown is sometimes called &ldquo;fluidity,&rdquo; and, for lack of a
better one, this term has been retained. It would thus appear
that if it were later observed that essential social
changes ensued, fluidity was one of the requisites of
change; and this is indeed in perfect tally with previous
thought upon the subject as set forth in our more theoretical
<a href="#Page_13">introduction</a> and expressed in the proposition that
fluidity is fundamental to social change.</p>

<p>The more general and preliminary treatment over, individual
and group reactions were then examined in greater
detail, and the phenomena of the major sort were singled
out and classified. These were found to be either abnormal
and handicapping such as emotional parturition; or stimulative
and promotive, as dynamogenic reaction. This constituted
the material of the <a href="#Chapter_2">second chapter</a>. Put in propositional
form it would be that catastrophe is attended
by phenomena of social psychology which may either retard
or promote social reorganization.</p>

<p><a href="#Chapter_3">Social organization</a> came next in order, and because its
progress was largely expedited by the organization of relief,&mdash;the
first social activity,&mdash;the sociological factors observed
in the latter have been recorded. These factors were
classified as physical, including climate and topography, and
psychological, such as leadership, suggestion, imitation, discussion,
recognition of utility and consciousness of kind.
Reference was also made to biological and equipmental
considerations. Two conclusions of interest are here deducible:
first, that part of society which is most closely
organized and disciplined in normality first recovers social
consciousness in catastrophe; second, it is only after
division of function delegates to a special group the responsibility
for relief work that public thought is directed
to the resumption of a normal society. These conclusions
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_143" title="143"> </a>
emphasize the conservation value to society of a militia
organization in every community and also of a permanent
vigilance committee.</p>

<p>The <a href="#Chapter_5">fifth chapter</a> introduced a relatively new element,
the presence of which may be relied upon in all future emergencies,
that of a disaster social service. Its contribution
was that of skillful service and wise direction; its
permanent effect, the socialization of the community. The
value of the presence of visiting social specialists is in inverse
proportion to the degree to which the socialization of a community
has advanced. The practical conclusion is clearly
that self-dependence of a community in adversity is furthered
by the socialization of the existing institutions.</p>

<p>The next and latest group to function effectively was that
of government, but <a href="#Chapter_6">social legislation</a> when forth-coming,
contributed an important and deciding influence, and was
itself in turn enriched by the calamity. Brought to the
test of comparison with observed facts the statement in the
introduction receives abundant justification; namely, that
catastrophe is in close association with progress in social
legislation.</p>

<p>To the influences already mentioned an additional factor
of recuperation is added,&mdash;the <a href="#Chapter_7">socio-economic one</a>. Disaster-stricken
communities cannot become normal until the
social surplus is restored. They may however always count
upon public aid. But there is found to be strongly suggested
a correlation between the magnitude or striking character
of a disaster and the generosity of the relief response.</p>

<p>The <a href="#Chapter_8">last chapter</a> is devoted to a cataloging of the indications
of social change from the standpoint of the community
as a whole. The old social order is contrasted with that
obtaining two years subsequent to the disaster. It here appeared
that the city of Halifax had as a community undergone
and is undergoing an extraordinary social change.
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_144" title="144"> </a>
This implies, according to the theory of social causation, an
extraordinary antecedent. Before finally accepting the factor
of catastrophe as such, the scientific reader may very
properly ask whether there are not alternatives.</p>

<p>To this query the answer is that there are alternatives,
other very considerable extra-social factors to be noted, but
that catastrophe was itself the precipitating factor there is
little room for doubt. Of the other factors two only are
of sufficient weight for our present consideration. The
earliest in order of time, and perhaps also in rank of importance
is that which Halifax residents understand as the
coming of the new ocean terminals. The coming was so
sudden in the nature of its announcement, and meant for
many so much depreciation in property values, that it had
something of the nature of catastrophe within it. It altered
very extensively the previously accepted ideas of residential
and business and industrial sections of the city, and caused
a jolt in the body politic, such as had not visited it for years&mdash;not
since the middle of the nineteenth century brought the
revolutionizing steam. It is not to be denied that this factor
has contributed not a little to the weakening of immobility,
and the preparation of the ground for an inrush of the spirit
of progress.</p>

<p>The other factor was the war. The war functioned
mightily in community organization for service. It brought
prosperity to many a door, and whetted the appetite of many
a merchant to put the business of peace on a war basis. But
it would be merely speculation to say that prosperity would
have continued in peace. Indeed such a conclusion would
not be historically justifiable. Halifax has been through
three important wars. In each, &ldquo;trade was active, prices
were high, the population increased, industry was stimulated
by the demand, rents doubled and trebled, streets were uncommonly
busy.&rdquo; But in each case also Halifax settled
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_145" title="145"> </a>
back to her ante-bellum sluggishness. In 1816 Halifax
began to feel the reaction consequent upon the close of a
war. The large navy and army were withdrawn and Halifax
and its inhabitants &ldquo;bore the appearance of a town at the
close of a fair. The sudden change from universal hustle
and business to ordinary pursuits made this alteration
at times very perceptible. Money gradually disappeared
and the failure of several mercantile establishments added
to the general distress.&rdquo; But the closing of the war, now
a hundred years later, has exhibited no such relapse. On
the other hand Halifax grows daily more prosperous and
progressive than before. Her bank clearings do not fail,
but rather increase. There is clearly some further influence
associated with this change.</p>

<p>But there is a very real sense in which the war may indeed
be said to have been the factor,&mdash;if we mean by it the
fact that through the war and as a direct result of war-service
the city was laid half in ruins by possibly the greatest
single catastrophe on the American Continent. If we
mean this, we have named the all-precipitating and determining
event. The catastrophe was an episode of the great
war.</p>

<p>It only remains to add by way of clearer definition
that the rôle of catastrophe appears to be both direct and indirect.
Functioning directly, it prepares the ground-work
for social change by (1) weakening social immobility;
(2) precipitating fluidity of custom; (3) forcing environal
favorability for change. Indirectly, it sets in motion
factors determining the nature of the social change, such as
(1) the release of spirit and morale; (2) the play of imitation;
(3) the stimulus of leaders and lookers-on; (4) the
socialization of institutions.</p>

<p>Our final principle<a name="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> thus appears to be that progress in
<a class="pagenum" name="Page_146" title="146"> </a>
catastrophe is a resultant of specific conditioning factors
some of which are subject to social control. If there is one
thing more than another which we would emphasize in conclusion
it is this final principle. Progress is not necessarily
a natural or assured result of change. It comes only
as a result of effort that is wisely expended and sacrifice
which is sacrifice in truth.</p>

<p>That the nature of the social change in Halifax is one
in the direction of progress we think to be based on reason
and not alone on hope. That it is also our fervent hope,
we need hardly add. But every Haligonian who cherishes
for his city the vision which this book contains, may help
mightily to bring it to pass by making effort his watchword
and intelligence his guide. We do not say it will all come
tomorrow. We do say a wonderful beginning has been made
since yesterday. And this is bright for the future. In no
better words can we conclude than in those of one of her
greatest lovers: &ldquo;Changes must come to Halifax. This
is a world of change. But every true Haligonian hopes that
the changes will not disfigure his beloved city, but only
heighten and enhance the intimate and haunting charms
she borrows from the sea.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>

&ldquo;Within a score of years disasters ... have cost thousands of lives,
have affected by personal injury, or destruction of property no fewer
than a million and a half persons and have laid waste property valued
at over a billion dollars ... the expectation based on past experience
is that each year no less than half a dozen such catastrophies will occur.&rdquo;

If nature abhors a vacuum, she also abhors stagnation. Is there not
reason behind all this action and reaction, these cycles and short-time
changes which her observers note? May it not well be that the ever-swinging
pendulum has a stir-up function to perform and that the
miniature daily catastrophies of life are the things which keep it
wholesome and sweet?

It is perhaps due to the reader to say that while this volume treats
specifically of Halifax, the writer has studied the records of many
disasters and these have been kept in mind in drawing his conclusions.
He participated in the rescue and relief work at Halifax in 1917, and
at the time of the Titanic disaster accompanied one of the expeditions
to the scene. He was in New York when the Wall Street explosion
occurred, and made a first hand study of its effects.

A special Citizens' Committee led the operations at the Paterson fire
and flood, but at the Chicago fire the City government took immediate

Mayor was the &ldquo;key to the situation.&rdquo; It should however be added
that both at Halifax and Dartmouth the chairmen of the Citizens'
Committees were ex-mayors.

There are other causes of conservatism. A comparative freedom
from disasters in the past is one. Halifax has suffered few in her
entire history. Indeed the cholera epidemic is the only one of any
consequence. She remained one of the last large wooden cities. Her
sister city, St. John, was stricken by a disastrous fire and stands to-day
safer, more substantial, more progressive in every way.
</p>
<p>
Again communities are generally conservative in character when a
large percentage are property-holding people. It was one of the surprises
of the Halifax catastrophe that so large a number of citizens
were found to own at least in part the homes they lived in.
</p>
<p>
There are other questions which the sociologist would ask if it were
possible to carry the investigation further. Is the community loath to
disturb the existing relations or to resort to extreme means to achieve
desired ends? Or is it eager to sweep away the old, to indulge in
radical experiment and to try any means that give promise of success?
He would study too the distribution of people relative to their interests.
Is there a majority of those whose experiences are narrow and whose
interests are few? Or is there a majority of those who have long enjoyed
varied experiences and cultivated manifold interests, that yet remain
harmonious? He studies the character of the choices, decisions,
selections in a people's industry, law-making, educational and religious
undertakings. It is thus that he proceeds in diagnosing a population
as to the degree of conservatism and to discover what the ideal community
should be.&mdash;Giddings, Franklin H., <cite>Inductive Sociology</cite> (N.&nbsp;Y.,

The earliest city-planning was mediaeval. Halifax was laid out by
military engineers with narrow streets&mdash;the &ldquo;ideal was a fortified enclosure
designed to accommodate the maximum number of inhabitants
with the minimum of space.&rdquo; In 1813 a town-planning scheme was set
on foot for the purpose of straightening streets, the removal of projections
and banks of earth and stones which at that time existed in the
center of streets. Considerable betterment resulted but unfortunately
many fine trees were cut down.

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
